          "description": "Okay, I think that we can all admit that ransomware has consumed the news cycle of late, thanks to high visibility attacks such as Colonial Pipeline and JBS. Interestingly enough, there wasn't this sort of reaction the second time the City of Baltimore got attacked, which (IMHO) belies the news cycle more than anything else.\nHowever, while the focus is on ransomware, for the moment, it's a good time to point out that there's more to this than just the attacks that get blasted across news feeds. That is, ransomware itself is an economy, an eco-system, which is a moniker that goes a long way to toward describing why victims of these attacks are impacted to the extent that they are. What I mean by this is that everything...EVERYTHING...about what goes into a ransomware attack is directed at tâ¦",

Very early on in the blog post is the statement:\nRansomware is by nature a post-exploitation tool, so before deploying it they must infiltrate the victim's infrastructure.Â \nOkay, so at this point, I'm looking for something juicy, some information regarding the TTPs used to \"infiltrate the victim's infrastructure\" and to locate files of interest for staging and exfil, but instead, the author(s) dove right into analyzing the malware itself, through reverse engineering.

I'm not only fascinated by the richness of the structure, but as I began writing a parser for LNK files, I began too see some interesting aspects of intelligence that can be gleaned from LNK files, in particular, those created within a threat actors development environment, and deployed to targets/infrastructures. First, there are different ways to create LNK files using the Windows API, and what's really cool is that each method has it's own unique #toolmarks associated with it!Â Â \nSecond, most often there is a pretty good amount of metadata embedded in the LNK file structure. There are file system time stamps, and often we'll see a NetBIOS system name, a volume S/N, a SID, or oâ¦",

I do not for a moment think that I've seen everything, and I, for one, find it fascinating when we find something that is either new, or that has been talked about but is being seen \"in the wild\" for the first time.\nSomeone mentioned recently that Microsoft's Antimalware Scan Interface (i.e., AMSI) could be used for persistence, and that got me very interested.Â  This isn't something specifically or explicitly covered by the MTRE ATT&CK framework, and I wanted to dig into this a bit more to understand it.

In this post, I'll take shot at netting out some of the more obvious benefits.\nMaintaining Corporate Knowledge\nRegardless of whether you're talking about an internal corporate position or a consulting role, analysts are going to see and learn new things based on their analysis.

In discussing a new #DFIR model, the question that arises is, how do we describe an artifact or toolmark constellation in a structured manner, so that it can be communicated and shared?Â Â \nOf course, the next step after that, once we have a structured format for describing these constellations, is automating the sharing and \"machine ingestion\" of these constellation descriptions.

          "description": "I ran across SharpWebServer via Twitter recently...the first line of the readme.md file states, \"A Red Team oriented simple HTTP & WebDAV server written in C# with functionality to capture Net-NTLM hashes.\" I thought this was fascinating because it ties directly to a technique MITRE refers to as \"Forced Authentication\".Â  What this means is that a threat actor can (and has...we'll get to that shortly) modify Windows shortcut/LNK files such that the iconfilename field points to an external resource. What happens is that when LNK file is launched, Explorer will reach out to the external resource and attempt to authenticate, sending NTLM hashes across the wire.Â  As such, SharpWebServer is built to capture those hashes.\nWhat this means is that a threat actor can gain access to an infrastructure, and as has been observed, use various means to maintain persistence...drop backdoors or RATs, create accounts on Internet-facing systems, etc.Â  However, many (albeit not all) of these means of persistence can be overcome via the judicious use of AV, EDR monitoring, and a universal password change.\nModifying the iconfilename field of an LNK file is a means of persisting beyond password changes, because even after passwords are change, the updated hashes will be sent across the wire.\nNow, I did say earlier that this has been used before, and it has.Â  CISA Alert TA18-074AÂ includes a section named \"Persistence through LNK file manipulation\".Â \nNote that from the alert, when looking at the \"Contents of enu.cmd\", \"Persistence through LNK file manipulation\", and \"Registry Modification\" sections, we can see a pretty comprehensive set of toolmarks associated with this threat actor.Â  This is excellent intrusion intelligence, and should be incorporated into any and all #DFIR parsing, enrichment and decoration, as well as threat hunting.\nHowever, things are even better! This tweet from bohopsÂ illustrates how to apply this technique to MSWord docs.",

Don't get me wrong, there is nothing wrong with keyword searches, as they're a great way to orient yourself to the data and provide pivot points into further analysis.Â  However, these searches should not be considered the end of your analysis; rather, they are simply be beginning, or at least early stages of the analysis.

This is what I'm doing now on a daily basis.\n Now you have:\n  \nyour account password\n your PIN you use together with the RSA-generated code\n and the RSA-generated code\n  \nThe RSA codes are compromised and you have to assume that there's some people out there knowing all the codes and algorithms. But that means they really aren't worth much, basically you only have a password and another, limited password called PIN - which is usually shorter and numbers only.\n The most you can expect from this is that - let's say - 10 characters alphanumeric + 6 digits is somewhat better than just the 10 characters alphanumeric, plus there's a good chance that they are stored in different systems, so less likely to seized at the same time by some black hats.\n Is that true or do these key fobs still have an added value?\n    submitted by    /u/mshthn  \n [link]   [comments]",

Every project is a brand new technology I've got little experience in and I always end up feeling like I couldn't possibly have tested it 100% properly. I have major anxiety and panic issues and I'm finding the entire thing just too stessful and have completely burnt out in a few short years. \n So my question is: Has anyone successfully transitioned into another IT space from cyber security? \n I would love to just be a sysadmin and only have a single network and set of technologies to contend with, so I can feel like i'll truly master them and become properly proficient. The problem is I think I'll have a lot of stigma going into interviews as it will be very obvious I couldn't handle netsec and am looking for an out, especially considering as I'm on Â£50k and will likely need to take a cut down to 25k-35k to get into a role like this.\n So any advice anyone can offer for how to approach this situation?

What im wondering is if theres anything anagalous like this in other popular languages like php ruby on rails django etc to do the same thing and if not is there any research regarding auth bypasses for open redirects which are more client side based and I donât believe they can be used for auth bypasses since forwards are internal/server sided and keep session and parameter data intact where as redirects are client sided and initialize fresh session data so they seem less useful then forwards.

At first I didn't read the full email so I entered the link and when I saw I needed a password, I thought that there must've been a mistake, so I typed a \"random\" password to see what would happen (I typed the same user as the pass) and I was able to log in. I was very confused as I was greeted with a page full of information regarding the account I was logged in to and as I explored further I was able to see personal information regarding other people that have done the quiz. At this point I realized that I wasn't supposed to be able to read this info so I logged out and tried another password (I was thinking that maybe the account accepted everything you typed) but no, I got a \"wrong password\" text. I read the email again, this time I saw that the password I was supposed to use was always there, I try it and I log in succesfully, but now it doesn't redirect me to the admin panel, it takes me to the psych test I'm supposed to be doing. As a NetSec Student, I know that I should let the company know about this weak password, but I don't know how to do it without it looking like I was on purpose trying to log in with another password different than the one provided via email and maybe get in trouble with the company I'm applying to.\n Worded as a question: What is the best way to let a company know that they have a vulnerability on an account?\n TL;DR: Got sent user and pass for an account, tried same user as pass instead (because I'm dumb and didn't read full email) and logged in as admin.

Has anyone else felt the same?\n Here are some examples working with different teams:\n  \nWork heavily with Kibana servers, but lacked fundamental database knowledge \n You would think someone managing a clusters would at least understand the basics of distributed systems\n \n Heavily use SIEMs, but could not tell you what a the concept of an operating system process beyond \"Yeah, it's a program that executes.\"\n A serious lack of web development knowledge\n  \nA lot of people entering the field claiming they are knowledgeable in network security, but can't forward engineer a basic CRUD app, and yet they'll claim they know how to reverse engineer it and secure it. Yeah, you're able to successfully complete a basic SQL injection hackthebox, but you could barely construct a SQL query yourself.

My current role is within IT operations as a systems engineer, but it's possibly evolving to be the first true role with an official information security component within the IT department at my company. I'm excited because I've always enjoyed the security aspects of my roles over my career, and my formal education was focused on information security. However, I recognize that I have no formal work experience in a security-specific role, and as such I feel like I'm \"winging it\".\n I don't really know what a formalized incident response looks like within an established security department. I don't know what tools I have at my disposal, or should have at my disposal, to do my job effectively. I also realize that I may be overthinking it. But truthfully, I have no point of reference.\n So I come to you all and ask for some opinions and insights to navigate as the sole person with these newly added responsibilities that I would liken to a security analyst, and do so in a way that makes sense and is effective. I'm happy to do my own reading and self-learning (I have access to PluralSight, if that would be useful), but also hoping maybe someone with experience can give some practical pointers and/or high-level procedural advice since I will likely be shaping this new role in coordination with my management.\n Thank you all in advance!\n Edited because my brain moved faster than my fingers could type :(\n    submitted by    /u/unseenspecter  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi. I'm new to this subreddit, so I'm not sure if my question is appropriate here. Feel free to direct me to another subreddit.\n After installing the beta version 7B86vAG4 of the BIOS for my MSI B450-A PRO motherboard, Secure Boot silently stopped working. That is, it boots any OS, for example, the Arch Linux installation medium. I see this behavior with factory default Secure Boot keys which likely are MSI's and Microsoft's keys and with my own keys. But keys shouldn't matter since the Arch Linux installation medium isn't signed by anybody:\n  \nThe official installation image does not support Secure Boot (FS#53864). To successfully boot the installation medium you will need to disable Secure Boot.\n  \nsource\n I reverted to the version 7B86vAD where Secure Boot works as expected.\n The last reply from the MSI support was:\n  \nI: I do not use Windows at all.\n Support: Generally speaking, the secure boot won't take effect if you system cannot be supported. Please don't worry about it. Thanks!\n  \nWell, I don't think I shouldn't worry about that. Secure Boot should work irrespective of the OS in this case since the OS isn't even booted. There are many people using Secure Boot with Linux.\n I would like to know whether this is just my motherboard or I set up Secure Boot incorrectly. If it's not just me, I feel obliged to report this bug somewhere. A user won't see it if they set up Secure Boot before upgrading their BIOS.\n    submitted by    /u/beroal  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Three months ago I received a newsletter from AltCoinTrader.co.za on my Gmail inbox. However, I never signed up for this site. I initially brushed it off for peace of mind. But I keep getting scared every time I remember it so I wanted to finish it by contacting the sites support and ask if my email was ever registered with them. To my horror, they said that someone did register but did not activate the account in May 2020. However, I could not find an activation email in my inbox, which has me worried that someone does have access to it and deleted it before I could see it. It is unlikely to be me since I wrote an email around the same time and other useless emails at that time period are still there.\n I have switched PCs since May 2020, but have kept my phone. My Gmail also has a new password + 2FA now. However, the new PC did share the same network briefly with my old PC. I very recently re-opened my old PC and did a thorough malware scan. Unfortunately, it found 3 Trojans. Current PC has had a clean bill of health so far. Problem is I have done very sensitive stuff on that PC from credit card details, SSN, online banking passwords, and, worst of all, confidential information for my work, including customers' personal data. \n I still don't know if I should treat this as a confirmed hack and/or full-on panic. Aside from this anomaly and the Trojans, the only other weird thing is my phone keeps logging account activity by itself sometimes (which I assume is it just pinging Google servers). Apart from that none of my accounts showed any signs of compromise. I also consulted someone earlier who said the Trojans could possibly be unrelated. And it is unclear what the motive is for someone to use someone else's email for crypto trading and log in to the account only to delete the confirmation email.\n Please help me with this. This is so strange, and a lot is at stake if I was compromised. I might actually get hospitalized over the stress from this.\n    submitted by    /u/WrestleMaykr  \n [link]   [comments]",

Either way, I am still a target.\n I need to put a VM on my machine (if thats the best way to do this, if not please say so), or multiple VM's.\n I need to know which VM to use, and how to make it so that if I do get malware on my VM, which I would be using all the time, it will not be able to pass through and attach itself on to my host machine.

Unfortunately it's also a necessary engagement channel for writers. \n I've banished it from my personal life but unfortunately need to be able to connect with readers and market my stuff.\n I recently paid for a session with a social media consultant that was aghast I was not on TikTok. I explained my political concerns with TikTok's links to certain authoritarian governments, as well as the massive data-mining hard-cooked into the code, and the evidence it's detrimental to mental health. \n She looked at me like I was a caveman wearing a tinfoil hat and went on to show me some metrics. Sadly it became clear that most of the reader demographic I'm trying to market my content to are using TikTok almost exclusively as their drug of choice. Fuck.\n So here's my question/TLDR:\n Is there a third-party application or method of \"corralling\" TikTok's spying functions? Is it possible to post via a desktop browser and bypass the application entirely? Should I look into running it inside an emulator? I'd certainly appreciate any input or suggestions!

I am currently writing a report and within the report format, \"reverse engineering\" and \"disassembly\" are two different sections. This doesn't really make much sense to me. Disassembly is already a form of reverse engineering. Nevertheless, the information that you could insert into an RE section would be Wireshark analysis, viewing the file in PEStudio for instance, but those are already in sections relating to static & dynamic analysis. \n So what would be inserted into a reverse engineering section regarding malware? I can literally only think of unpacking the malware as everything else that would constitute reverse engineering is in other sections. Honestly, I have no idea. When I asked for some help in regards to knowing the distinction between the two, I was told that \"disassembly\" is a noun, and \"reverse engineering\" is a verb. Which is probably right, but it didn't help at all. An example of breaking encryption was proposed in relation to RE. Again, it didn't shed much light for me.\n I just want to be familiar with the distinction here. Thanks.\n    submitted by    /u/pat0000  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have a limited background in network security understanding from my undergrad in computer science, but have not dipped my toes in seriously in a while, so kinda stumbling through trying to figure this out.\n A friend asked me to check their network for any rogue listening devices and after a quick scan with Nmap, I came across this device on 192.168.0.1 described as \"blackice-icecap\". A quick google search makes it sound like this might actual be some kind of device setup to monitor network traffic. Is this something that is worth digging deeper into or am I misunderstanding this?\n What other avenues for rogue network monitoring should I be looking into? My first thought is that this is all probably a bit over my head, but I thought I'd at least give it a quick peak to see if I can find anything obvious to help my friend out.\n Thanks again for any feedback or advice.\n For reference, here is the relevant part of the Nmap result:\n  \nNmap scan report for 192.168.0.1 \n Host is up (0.033s latency). \n Not shown: 995 closed tcp ports (conn-refused) \n PORT STATE SERVICE \n 80/tcp open http \n 443/tcp open https \n 5000/tcp open upnp \n 8081/tcp filtered blackice-icecap \n 8082/tcp filtered blackice-alerts\n  \nâ\n    submitted by    /u/wwants  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi, I'm currently learning about c and the classic vulnerabilities that arise. Right now buffer overflows\n â\n So, just to sum up my understanding, an example like this will overflow because 'ab' is of two bytes is too big to store in the last byte of \"buff\":\n char buff[10]; \n buff[9] = 'ab';\n The wiki article about buffer overflows define them as follows:\n  \n\"while writing data) to a buffer, overruns the buffer's boundary\"\n  \nThis got me thinking that this sounds a lot like integer overflows. Trying to put something into a container that it cannot contain.\n But let's take the following example of a integer overflow (I use unsigned char for having most simple case):\n unsigned char c = 255; \n unsigned char cc = c + 1;\n Ok, so the single byte of the char cannot contain a value higher than 255, and thus it does modulo.\n And my understanding of integer overflow is that internally, the computer tries to put a 1 to the left of the current numbe, such that if 255 looks like this:\n 11111111 \n then it simply assumes that there exists a place that represents 256, and tries to create this binary number:\n 100000000 \n But there is no such bit, and therefore the number just becomes 00000000.\n But the single 1 that is lost doesnt that go somewhere in memory?\n For that reason, my thought was that integer overflows had have to also contain buffer overflows. \n Is this true?\n â\n Further thoughts\n At the core of the issue is a question of what actually constitutes a buffer in c.\n You could maybe argue that this problem would have been better suited for r/learnprogramming.\n But yeah, my guess is that it depends on whether or not a certain variable counts as buffers.\n is a int a buffer? is a char[]? etc?\n    submitted by    /u/GarseBo  \n [link]   [comments]",

Until I can get a job that isn't with my current employer/in this sector, I have to play the game as best I can.\n I am trying to find both a cheap and good masters degree program I can do part time and online (or at least one that is ABET\\would make managers who only care about ABET happy). I am both looking at computer science and cybersecurity masters, but I got a B.S. in cybersecurity which makes masters of computer science hard to get into.\n So far, the only one I have found that checks those boxes is Georgia Tech's online masters (though I seriously doubt they will let me in the computer science program so I will have to do the cybersecurity one). I keep digging around but it seems all the ones I can find either charge high rates, and/or lack anything actually being taught. \n Do you guys know of any? All the digging around I have done has shown me that its that or get ready to fork out 30k+ (if I didn't already pay too much for my B.S.).\n    submitted by    /u/RandomPerson05478  \n [link]   [comments]",

You can limit it by something like IP, but there have been several real world examples which show how cheap it is to quickly spin up thousands of different IPs to bypass this protection via AWS/Azure. I'm not aware of any other techniques that could identify legitimate requests from illegitimate ones. My thinking was something like a system in which successful logins log the IP from which it was accessed and allow login attempts from that IP even if the user is locked out.

All DNS caches should be empty. The router connections page shows 1 connection from my Windows machine to 13.?.?.? with status SYN_SENT. Of course, it didn't connect, but how did it know what external IP to try without DNS?\n The IP is a Microsoft one but I didn't write down what it was (and I didn't save search history) since I initially didn't think it was strange. I tried repeating the same thing several times, but never saw anymore external IPs (but a bunch of 198.x.x.x which is what I'd expect when internet is down). The only difference the first time is that it was installing a previously downloaded Windows update.\n Is this unusual? Is MS known to go directly to IP addresses like this?

Using the context aware access feature from gSuite https://support.google.com/a/answer/9275380?product_name=UnuFlow&hl=en&visit_id=637758886340041076-3475162686&rd=1&src=supportwidget0&hl=en\n  \nPro: set up seems straightforward, and can configure based on teams\n Con: pay more per user, it's like $8 more per user to our current edition\n  \nb. Set up gSuite to login with Okta via SAML, and then configure Okta log on policies to require VPN for certain users https://support.google.com/a/answer/6369487?product_name=UnuFlow&hl=en&visit_id=637758886340041076-3475162686&rd=1&src=supportwidget0&hl=en#zippy=%2Csso-usernetwork-mapping-matrix\n  \nPro: Saves money, get more familiar with SAML which seems useful?\n Questions for experts here about this approach: \n Is it easy to quickly provision which users are required to login via Okta and VPN? Anything we should be careful about? The process seems quite complicated.\n How much time will it take?\n Technically how is this different from option a? I guess gSuite does all the configuration automatically for you to save the time?\n \n  \nâ\n Which one would you advise us to go for?

Here are my plans, currently for the last 4 years I've fully switched to GNU/Linux and even switched my phone OS to a privacy respecting one (GrapheneOS). I plan on having a server that will have Jellyfin on it accessed remote via Caddy (Reverse Proxy), NextCloud as an alternative to Google Drive/Google Photos, and an OpenVPN connection to my home network and PiHole.\n My main concern is that I would like to build a separate gaming PC that will run Windows, also if I have friends over they would need WiFi. Is it possible to separate my home network into 3 smaller networks with seperate SSID's that won't communicate between eachother (basically what I'm asking is it possible to have separate networks for guests and me ?\n â\n I would have some IoT devices such as a smart TV but is it possible to filter it out in ACL so that the TV only has LAN but can't connect to the internet ?\n Since I'm moving out it will be a great learning experience to make my home network. Now I have a few questions and I hope some of you lovely people could answer them. Keep in mind I'm focused on privacy and security mostly here.\n  \nWhich router should I go for ? Which model is the best, should I go for OpenWRT ?\n Should I get a L3 switch ? If so what model would be the best ?\n Is it possible to separate my home network into smaller ones that won't communicate between each other (guest, my personal and IoT LAN devices) ?\n  \nWell that's all the questions I have, thank you in advance.\n â\n EDIT: I forgot to add this I would need WiFi so that means I would need some WiFi Access Points, which models should I look for ? \n    submitted by    /u/throwaway89722316  \n [link]   [comments]",

Told me if i want to study malware analysis i should study architecture and os. \n The interviewer liked that i am a geek the most part and although it isnât my major i kept studying security and exploitation. Between the time of my service and now i should start studying networks ,web,os,and architecture.

I can get help on this question in that services sub later. \n Thank you for your help in advance.\n    submitted by    /u/Famous_Relative2500  \n [link]   [comments]",

All the moderators here wish you a relaxing and safe time with your families and friends. Hopefully we all will get a breather from the crazy world of Cyber Security and Networking.\n A couple of updates right off the bat â\n  \nWeâve noticed an uptick in traffic for the subreddit over the past couple of months. Page views are up roughly 35% since the all-time lows of June-July when the subreddit was locked from the original admin. We are very happy with the increase, as it allows more collaboration and questions to be answered.\n Survey requests are no longer accepted on the subreddit going forward. We had a bit of a conversation internally on this topic as they seem to come up once or twice a week. Usually these are from college students requesting information for a class or study. We wish to continue and help anyone in school to best of our ability, but most of the time these surveys results are not shared publicly, and only benefit the survey creator. Due to this we donât see it beneficial to include them. Weâve added surveys to rule 2 of what is relevant to the subreddit.\n Going into the new year, we hope to start providing everyone with some AMAs from verified industry professionals. Weâve been talking about this internally for a bit.\n  \nState of the subreddit posts will most likely continue once every quarter (3 months). Thanks to everyone for continuing to contribute to the subreddit and continuing to report posts that break the rules. Even if you are unsure, your reports are appreciated.\n Have a fantastic holiday, and if you need anything, donât hesitate to reach out to us directly.\n -AskNetSec Mod Team\n    submitted by    /u/Envyforme  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello, im taking a course by Sektor7. i have the problem that, no matter in which way i try, i cant get a metasploit payload executed correctly by any loader (cpp) in the course. The program run, but there was no meterpreter session opened no more What I tried:\n  \nSimple xor encryption and decryption\n Simple AES encryption and decryption\n Even base64 encoding doesnt work for me\n  \nI also tried to research the root of the problem with no success. The source I used already was fixed for all problems any debugger gave me:\n The python script for aes encryption: https://pastebin.com/Qyxa3Zrr\n The cpp loader that decrypts and runs the payload in memory: https://pastebin.com/MfVynd45\n the compiler (a custom batch): https://pastebin.com/rn6zXfqi\n I already tried to generate a PE with msfvenom and run it through the python, did not work. I tried to generate the raw payload with msfvenom, then encrypt it manually and put in aes key and payload into the cpp, didnt work. I tried to generate with -f raw -o 1.bin, then run the .bin through the python, didnt work.\n Note: Only the provided shellcodes by Sektor7 seem to work flawlessly. These have no other function besides executing the calc.exe from the System32 folder or showing basic messages. Maybe the sheer size of metasploit generated payloads or its custom functions make them going broken during the cryption and compilation process? If yes, why and how to design the loaders they dont break the payload?\n    submitted by    /u/janameyers2002  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Please remove this if it doesn't fit in with this sub, I'm asking here because this seems to be the most common place to discuss appsec. \n A little about myself: \n I'm currently working in a helpdesk role in Australia and have been practicing both offensive netsec and web application security/exploit dev for a little while.\n I like both netsec and appsec but netsec bores me a little bit and I really enjoy coding/learning about applications and exploiting them.\n The issue I'm having is that helpdesk work seems to line up nicely with network pentesting, and I don't have a degree or any development experience. But with that said I'd really enjoy doing application security as a career.\n Does anyone have any advice in regards to entering the application security world from a support role? Or would it be better for me to pursue network security and then try to switch to application security later? \n Also should I pursue any certs that might help? I've thought about OSWE in the future.\n Any advice would be great, and again if this post doesn't belong here I can delete. Thanks.\n    submitted by    /u/n3v327311  \n [link]   [comments]",

I held sessions where we practiced (beginner) buffer overflows. \n While in school I had done research on hardware reverse engineering, focused on medical devices. \n That got me to present with my peers at our local bsides. I then was able to present at IEEE southeastcon, which got me a job as a security engineer before graduating. \n -----â\n 1) Is it possible to get into exploit dev without a degree or is it absolutely necessary?\n 2) should I go the pentester route and then exploit dev?\n 3) do you see security engineers break into this field or does it tend to be developers? I don't do any software engineering, but I do a lot of tooling in powershell, python, and recently, go. I know C but hardly. \n 4) should I just shaddup and start learning?

Have a few questions :\n 1) Can using fdisk -l or parted -l modify data on the hdd ? (both launched as root) What about gparted ? (if not touching anything oc) 2) Working as root, is chmod a-w /dev/sde (the drive \"location\") really useful, like will it really prevent any write even from root ? 3) Created an image with dcfldd, asked for sha1 checksum, and before imaging used sha1sum on /dev/sde. They match. Do anyone work another way ? 4) Tried to import the image on autopsy with different settings but no file or anything else found. Then successfully linked to /dev/loop1 using losetup, but could not mount the \"partition\" (no filesystem nor partition is detected with parted -l, but gparted tells sde is an ataraid partition). Had some error like \"unknown filesystem type 'ddf_raid_member'\", so after a bit of digging tried some stuff with mdamd, but did not work.

The lower level analysts serve more of a traffic cop type of role; they weed out the easily spotted false-positives and may start very basic reviews of true positive events before handing off to the higher level analysts for analysis.\n In this setup, all members of the SOC have full access to M365 (all mailboxes, all OneDrives). This is in addition to the ability to triage machines via an EDR tool and collect files through that tool.\n My question: is that type of access appropriate for the lower level analysts?

I do not come from a background in IT, and have been figuring this all out on my own in the past few years. I have acquired a set (x3) of USB drives to collect images and videos from clients phones in an easier way. I have added the exact nomenclature of what I have below. I need this to be done in a forensically sound manner, and I am currently going through the steps to validate my theory these collect data in a forensically sound manner. To be forensically sound any media should be \"zeroed\" or wiped prior to use. Herein lies my question. With these flash drives they obviously have some sort of proprietary software which makes them work. If I were to format these I would lose this proprietary software. What would be a way I could format these drives and then return them to \"manufacturer settings\"?\n â\n I have looked into USB duplicators, not sure if this could be a forensically sound option.

We are putting a budget together (cellebrite's sales people are annoyingly hard to get in contact with) and we've got our prices ballparked and everything looks good except a computer build. We've talked with 2 other cellebrite users who both said they had to buy a $4-5k desktop build to work efficiently with cellebrite.\n I've built a pc before and have a basic knowledge about them, however I don't get these $4k+ build costs when all that's really necessary is an average build with an intell processor and a decent amount of ram. Besides that I have put in a good chunk of the budget to cover memory and additional hard drives to handle data/evidence. \n Are the other cellebrite users just getting railroaded by vendors selling them over priced pre-built models or is there something more to the build/requirements.\n Any advice would be greatly appreciated.\n    submitted by    /u/crimsontidepride  \n [link]   [comments]",

However, based on how little experience I have with PA, \"opening a case\" seems to just be a prompt to import extractions all over again.

Since here in Brazil you first need a CS degree to do a computer forensics course, I'm focused on finishing my CS course first for now.\n I looked at the FAQ here and got a lot of useful information, but I still have one that wasn't answered: what are the fields you can work? I know you can work in law enforcement and do forensics analysis to find digital evidence of a suspect (wich is most cases I belive), but can you work on the investigation field (like tracing criminals online)? If not, how do I work on this investigation field related to crimes online? Is computer forensics the best thing to study in this case?\n Another question is: on the private work field, how does it work?

It's useful as you may know that a book is unavailable in realtime if the cover is empty, without having to click on the book link.\n  \nâ\n ANNOUNCEMENT:\n The calibre story started 2 years ago and during this long travel another sub more focused on this kind of content has been created for some various reasons.\n For this new year, I've decided to stop sharing the calishots in the current sub. If you're still interested in future dumps you can track them on the other one.\n Other resources will be proposed on it soon, like a wiki, tips, the datasets, original calibres, and some news about related tools like calisuck, calishot ... which are now turning into a single new project and will be released soon.\n Your contributions are also welcome on the sub.\n    submitted by    /u/krazybug  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi Reddit,\n I've been trying to download this website (Cisco RV325 Emulator - Emulator) for full offline usage, and have used a variety of different tools with little success so far. I know it can be done because people have linked zip file downloads for other emulators in the cisco forums.\n I've tried wget, httrack, archivebox and several online website downloaders, however the problem I'm facing is as follows:\n If I download https://www.cisco.com/assets/sol/sb/RV325_Emulators/RV325_Emulator-SB_v1-2-1-14/default.htm I can load up the page locally but clicking on any of the menu items does nothing. It is just a static page which looks correct but isn't functional. I've tested winhttrack and wget settings of (-m -k) (-r -np -c) and another which uses (-l0) but I can't remember what the rest of the args were.\n From inspecting some of the urls using the online working version, I can see that each menu item has its own unique .htm page, which can be opened separately (online) if you just wanted to view that page and not be able to traverse to other pages (there is no menu bar).\n For example:\n Main Page - https://www.cisco.com/assets/sol/sb/RV325_Emulators/RV325_Emulator-SB_v1-2-1-14/default.htm\n Using the sidebar to go from Homepage > Port Management > Port setup, the online url is unchanged but clearly a separate static page for it exists because you can go to https://www.cisco.com/assets/sol/sb/RV325_Emulators/RV325_Emulator-SB_v1-2-1-14/lan_setting.htm and access the same thing (only that page's settings, not anything else)\n This means that if I downloaded this lan_setting.htm page and pointed to it in the local html, I should be able to access it right?\n The problem is that I don't know how to find all of these individual settings .htm page urls, and downloading them all manually and setting up local links in the main html file would take forever.\n â\n I hope I've explained this well enough, please accept my apologies in advance if I haven't !\n    submitted by    /u/prymenumba  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Before you tell me to just shill for a VPS, run a crawler and some scripts; I would like to offer some insight. I like collecting old web GIFs and pixel art. These are typically from websites which are hardly active, or in some cases no longer online. Places other people would, usually, share on r/opendirectories. Ergo, whenever I pick these out it's already going to be a manual process.\n I suppose I can just right click + save as, a few hundred times, but I have found Pinterest's \"Save Button\" to also be convenient. It's an extension that scans the entire page quickly, and you can choose what to save through a convenient menu, and it even builds a gallery for me. I want to reshare these, so I don't consider it a violation of my privacy that they are being exposed under my account name. False Account Suspensions aren't unheard of, but it's been working for me so far. Except whenever I need to save any image smaller than 100x100 pixels.\n Pinterest has a restriction requiring all images to be above 100x100 in resolution, so in this case you have to Save As, pad out the background and then upload. Which is again, a level of tedium I would like to avoid.\n So, would any of you lovely folks happen to know any decent alternatives?\n    submitted by    /u/themadprogramer  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Please delete if not allowed\n Hi guys, awhile ago I made a quick and easy browser tool to convert links into a VLC Playlist, you might be wondering why I opted out of M3U playlists, honestly for future expansion, m3u playlists tend to be pretty simple on the SPEC, can't define much, while XPSF allows for things like duration setting. It is a goal to rewrite this eventually and figure out a way of showing the duration, probably using an API of some kind. (my tool: https://csmit195.github.io/Links-to-XSPF-Web-App/)\n I have two files, one is 14.1k movies, and the other is 4.1k movies. My PC is fairly fast and loading the 14.1k movies took about 3mins, while the 4.1k only takes 10secs. Please test carefully with the 14.1k, some PC's might fail to load it, vlc could crash b4 finish loading.\n Downloads:\n note: the top 1.1k movies of both files are more popular than the ones below it\n 14.1K Movies (4.1K Movies from below included)\n https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gSjguuPTTyP_2oVktKD_YqbaAZStpEu4/view?usp=sharing\n 4.1K Movies\n https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dSb3d_CDbsvR7UO8nnnDBdYmJmsuBPv2/view?usp=sharing\n If you want more or have a really good source of direct movie links, feel free to lmk and I'll create more playlists. For now, enjoy and would love feedback (please no code reviews, I made it quickly so I can achieve this goal, wasn't really built for production, I'd love to optimise it in the future tho.\n Cheers,\n Chris\n    submitted by    /u/csmit195  \n [link]   [comments]",
