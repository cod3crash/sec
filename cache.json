It can do a lot to boost your confidence and help you deliver a product that you're proud of.\nWhen I first started writing books, the process of going from idea to a published book was pretty set...or so I thought, being new and naïve to the whole thing. I put together an idea for a book, and started on an outline; I did this largely because the publisher was asking for things like a \"word count\". Then they'd send me a questionnaire to complete regarding the potential efficacy of the book, and they'd send my responses to a panel of \"experts\" within the industry to provide their thoughts and insight.\nHowever, there wasn't a great deal of insight i…",

What do you use it to prove most?\nLike almost everything else in DFIR, my response to the both questions is, it depends. Why? Well, it depends upon the goals of your investigation. What I use the Registry to prove depends heavily on what I'm trying to prove, or to disprove. This may sound pretty obvious, and even intuitive, but far too often in DFIR, we can find ourselves far too easily chasing down rabbit holes that have little, if anything, to do with our investigative goals.\nConfiguration\nThe Windows Registry holds a g…",

Sometimes, we may have the data available to assist us in discovering the root cause of the process launch; for example, in the case of processes launched via web shell, all you need to do is trace backward through the process tree until you get to the web server process (i.e., w3wp.exe, etc.).\nOther ti…",

I've seen incident response teams referred to as \"Cyber SEALs\", as well as via various other terms. However, when you really look at, incident response is much more akin to the US Army Special Forces, aka \"Green Berets\"; you have to \"parachute in\" to a foreign environment, and quickly develop a response capability making use of the customer's staff (\"the natives\"), all of whom live in a \"foreign culture\". As such, IR is less about \"direct action\" and \"hostage rescue\", and more about \"foreign internal defense\".\nAnalysis occurs when an analyst applies their knowledge and experience to data, and is usually predicated by a parsing phase.

You may see something run in EDR telemetry, or in logs, but the context of when it ran in relation to other activities is often critical. Did it occur immediately following a system reboot or a user login? Does it occur repeatedly? Does it occur on other systems? Did it occur in rapid succession with other commands, indicating that perhaps it was scripted? The how and when of the context then leads to attribution.\nAndy Piazza brings the same thoughts to CTI in his article, \"CTI is Better Served with Context\".\nAutomation can be a wonderful thing, if you use it, and use it to your advantage. The bad guys do it all the time. Automation means you don't have to remember steps (because you will forget), and it drives consistency and efficiency. Even …",

After all, it was almost two years ago that we saw the first instance of ransomware threat actors stating publicly that they'd exfiltrated data from systems, using this a secondary means of extortion. Since then, we've continued to see this tactic used, along with other tertiary means of extortion based on data exfiltration. We've also seen several instances where the threat actor ransom notes have stated that data was exfiltrated but the public \"shaming\" sites were noticeably empty.\nAs long as I've been involved in what was first referred to as \"information security\" (later referred to as \"cyber security\"), data exfiltration has been a concern to one degree or another, even i…",

Find an entry for a file in the AmCache? Great. But does that mean it was executed on the system? No, it does not...you need to validate execution with other artifacts in the constellation (EDR telemetry, host-based effects such as an application prefetch file, Registry modifications, etc.).\n\n\nHave a thorough process, one that you can add to and extend.

I've seen the birth and growth of Sysmon, as well as MS's \"internal\" Process Tracking (which requires an additional Registry modification to record full command lines). I've also seen Nuix Adaptive Security up close (including seeing it used specifically for threat hunting), which rounds out my exposure. So, I haven't seen all tools by any stretch of the imagination, but mor…",

What happens is that when LNK file is launched, Explorer will reach out to the external resource and attempt to authenticate, sending NTLM hashes across the wire.  As such, SharpWebServer is built to capture those hashes.\nWhat this means is that a threat actor can gain access to an infrastructure, and as has been observed, use various means to maintain persistence...drop backdoors or RATs, create accounts on Internet-facing systems, etc.  However, many (albeit not all) of these means of persistence can be overcome via the judicious use of AV, EDR monitoring, and a universal password change.\nModifying the iconfilename field of an LNK file is a means of persisting beyond password changes, because even after passwords are change, the updated hashes will be sent across the wire.\nNow, I did say earlier that this has been used before, and it has.  CISA Alert TA18-074A includes a section named \"Persistence through LNK file manipulation\". \nNote that from the alert, when looking at the \"Contents of enu.cmd\", \"Persistence through LNK file manipulation\", and \"Registry Modification\" sections, we can see a pretty comprehensive set of toolmarks associated with this threat actor.  This is excellent intrusion intelligence, and should be incorporated into any and all #DFIR parsing, enrichment and decoration, as well as threat hunting.\nHowever, things are even better!

          "description": "Hi. I'm new to this subreddit, so I'm not sure if my question is appropriate here. Feel free to direct me to another subreddit.\n After installing the beta version 7B86vAG4 of the BIOS for my MSI B450-A PRO motherboard, Secure Boot silently stopped working. That is, it boots any OS, for example, the Arch Linux installation medium. I see this behavior with factory default Secure Boot keys which likely are MSI's and Microsoft's keys and with my own keys. But keys shouldn't matter since the Arch Linux installation medium isn't signed by anybody:\n  \nThe official installation image does not support Secure Boot (FS#53864). To successfully boot the installation medium you will need to disable Secure Boot.\n  \nsource\n I reverted to the version 7B86vAD where Secure Boot works as expected.\n The last reply from the MSI support was:\n  \nI: I do not use Windows at all.\n Support: Generally speaking, the secure boot won't take effect if you system cannot be supported. Please don't worry about it. Thanks!\n  \nWell, I don't think I shouldn't worry about that. Secure Boot should work irrespective of the OS in this case since the OS isn't even booted. There are many people using Secure Boot with Linux.\n I would like to know whether this is just my motherboard or I set up Secure Boot incorrectly. If it's not just me, I feel obliged to report this bug somewhere. A user won't see it if they set up Secure Boot before upgrading their BIOS.\n    submitted by    /u/beroal  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Three months ago I received a newsletter from AltCoinTrader.co.za on my Gmail inbox. However, I never signed up for this site. I initially brushed it off for peace of mind. But I keep getting scared every time I remember it so I wanted to finish it by contacting the sites support and ask if my email was ever registered with them. To my horror, they said that someone did register but did not activate the account in May 2020. However, I could not find an activation email in my inbox, which has me worried that someone does have access to it and deleted it before I could see it. It is unlikely to be me since I wrote an email around the same time and other useless emails at that time period are still there.\n I have switched PCs since May 2020, but have kept my phone. My Gmail also has a new password + 2FA now. However, the new PC did share the same network briefly with my old PC. I very recently re-opened my old PC and did a thorough malware scan. Unfortunately, it found 3 Trojans. Current PC has had a clean bill of health so far. Problem is I have done very sensitive stuff on that PC from credit card details, SSN, online banking passwords, and, worst of all, confidential information for my work, including customers' personal data. \n I still don't know if I should treat this as a confirmed hack and/or full-on panic. Aside from this anomaly and the Trojans, the only other weird thing is my phone keeps logging account activity by itself sometimes (which I assume is it just pinging Google servers). Apart from that none of my accounts showed any signs of compromise. I also consulted someone earlier who said the Trojans could possibly be unrelated. And it is unclear what the motive is for someone to use someone else's email for crypto trading and log in to the account only to delete the confirmation email.\n Please help me with this. This is so strange, and a lot is at stake if I was compromised. I might actually get hospitalized over the stress from this.\n    submitted by    /u/WrestleMaykr  \n [link]   [comments]",

I am currently writing a report and within the report format, \"reverse engineering\" and \"disassembly\" are two different sections. This doesn't really make much sense to me. Disassembly is already a form of reverse engineering. Nevertheless, the information that you could insert into an RE section would be Wireshark analysis, viewing the file in PEStudio for instance, but those are already in sections relating to static & dynamic analysis. \n So what would be inserted into a reverse engineering section regarding malware? I can literally only think of unpacking the malware as everything else that would constitute reverse engineering is in other sections. Honestly, I have no idea. When I asked for some help in regards to knowing the distinction between the two, I was told that \"disassembly\" is a noun, and \"reverse engineering\" is a verb. Which is probably right, but it didn't help at all. An example of breaking encryption was proposed in relation to RE.

Right now buffer overflows\n ​\n So, just to sum up my understanding, an example like this will overflow because 'ab' is of two bytes is too big to store in the last byte of \"buff\":\n char buff[10]; \n buff[9] = 'ab';\n The wiki article about buffer overflows define them as follows:\n  \n\"while writing data) to a buffer, overruns the buffer's boundary\"\n  \nThis got me thinking that this sounds a lot like integer overflows. Trying to put something into a container that it cannot contain.\n But let's take the following example of a integer overflow (I use unsigned char for having most simple case):\n unsigned char c = 255; \n unsigned char cc = c + 1;\n Ok, so the single byte of the char cannot contain a value higher than 255, and thus it does modulo.\n And my understanding of integer overflow is that internally, the computer tries to put a 1 to the left of the current numbe, such that if 255 looks like this:\n 11111111 \n then it simply assumes that there exists a place that represents 256, and tries to create this binary number:\n 100000000 \n But there is no such bit, and therefore the number just becomes 00000000.\n But the single 1 that is lost doesnt that go somewhere in memory?\n For that reason, my thought was that integer overflows had have to also contain buffer overflows. \n Is this true?\n ​\n Further thoughts\n At the core of the issue is a question of what actually constitutes a buffer in c.\n You could maybe argue that this problem would have been better suited for r/learnprogramming.\n But yeah, my guess is that it depends on whether or not a certain variable counts as buffers.\n is a int a buffer? is a char[]? etc?\n    submitted by    /u/GarseBo  \n [link]   [comments]",

You can limit it by something like IP, but there have been several real world examples which show how cheap it is to quickly spin up thousands of different IPs to bypass this protection via AWS/Azure. I'm not aware of any other techniques that could identify legitimate requests from illegitimate ones.

All DNS caches should be empty. The router connections page shows 1 connection from my Windows machine to 13.?.?.? with status SYN_SENT.

Anything we should be careful about? The process seems quite complicated.\n How much time will it take?\n Technically how is this different from option a?

I plan on having a server that will have Jellyfin on it accessed remote via Caddy (Reverse Proxy), NextCloud as an alternative to Google Drive/Google Photos, and an OpenVPN connection to my home network and PiHole.\n My main concern is that I would like to build a separate gaming PC that will run Windows, also if I have friends over they would need WiFi. Is it possible to separate my home network into 3 smaller networks with seperate SSID's that won't communicate between eachother (basically what I'm asking is it possible to have separate networks for guests and me ?\n ​\n I would have some IoT devices such as a smart TV but is it possible to filter it out in ACL so that the TV only has LAN but can't connect to the internet ?\n Since I'm moving out it will be a great learning experience to make my home network. Now I have a few questions and I hope some of you lovely people could answer them. Keep in mind I'm focused on privacy and security mostly here.\n  \nWhich router should I go for ? Which model is the best, should I go for OpenWRT ?\n Should I get a L3 switch ?

The issue resides in the Azure App Service, when users use the “Local Git” deployment method to deploy to the Azure App Service, the .git folder gets created in the content root, which puts their data and source code at risk for information disclosure. \n This behavior of Azure App Service via Local Git was known to Microsoft and the company added a “web.config” file to the .git folder within the public directory that restricted public access.

All the moderators here wish you a relaxing and safe time with your families and friends. Hopefully we all will get a breather from the crazy world of Cyber Security and Networking.\n A couple of updates right off the bat –\n  \nWe’ve noticed an uptick in traffic for the subreddit over the past couple of months. Page views are up roughly 35% since the all-time lows of June-July when the subreddit was locked from the original admin. We are very happy with the increase, as it allows more collaboration and questions to be answered.\n Survey requests are no longer accepted on the subreddit going forward. We had a bit of a conversation internally on this topic as they seem to come up once or twice a week. Usually these are from college students requesting information for a class or study. We wish to continue and help anyone in school to best of our ability, but most of the time these surveys results are not shared publicly, and only benefit the survey creator. Due to this we don’t see it beneficial to include them. We’ve added surveys to rule 2 of what is relevant to the subreddit.\n Going into the new year, we hope to start providing everyone with some AMAs from verified industry professionals. We’ve been talking about this internally for a bit.\n  \nState of the subreddit posts will most likely continue once every quarter (3 months). Thanks to everyone for continuing to contribute to the subreddit and continuing to report posts that break the rules. Even if you are unsure, your reports are appreciated.\n Have a fantastic holiday, and if you need anything, don’t hesitate to reach out to us directly.\n -AskNetSec Mod Team\n    submitted by    /u/Envyforme  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello, im taking a course by Sektor7. i have the problem that, no matter in which way i try, i cant get a metasploit payload executed correctly by any loader (cpp) in the course. The program run, but there was no meterpreter session opened no more What I tried:\n  \nSimple xor encryption and decryption\n Simple AES encryption and decryption\n Even base64 encoding doesnt work for me\n  \nI also tried to research the root of the problem with no success. The source I used already was fixed for all problems any debugger gave me:\n The python script for aes encryption: https://pastebin.com/Qyxa3Zrr\n The cpp loader that decrypts and runs the payload in memory: https://pastebin.com/MfVynd45\n the compiler (a custom batch): https://pastebin.com/rn6zXfqi\n I already tried to generate a PE with msfvenom and run it through the python, did not work. I tried to generate the raw payload with msfvenom, then encrypt it manually and put in aes key and payload into the cpp, didnt work. I tried to generate with -f raw -o 1.bin, then run the .bin through the python, didnt work.\n Note: Only the provided shellcodes by Sektor7 seem to work flawlessly. These have no other function besides executing the calc.exe from the System32 folder or showing basic messages. Maybe the sheer size of metasploit generated payloads or its custom functions make them going broken during the cryption and compilation process? If yes, why and how to design the loaders they dont break the payload?\n    submitted by    /u/janameyers2002  \n [link]   [comments]",

App B uses that same file name + path and does limited/no checking that it's created by App B and not another app and leads to undesirable effects. (One could argue this is a vulnerability in App B by itself but)\n But are there actually examples where something like this has happened? Someone's banking app is compromised because they also have the Delta app on their phone, etc. etc.\n Thanks for satiating my curiosity.\n    submitted by    /u/CorbinGDawg69  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Please remove this if it doesn't fit in with this sub, I'm asking here because this seems to be the most common place to discuss appsec. \n A little about myself: \n I'm currently working in a helpdesk role in Australia and have been practicing both offensive netsec and web application security/exploit dev for a little while.\n I like both netsec and appsec but netsec bores me a little bit and I really enjoy coding/learning about applications and exploiting them.\n The issue I'm having is that helpdesk work seems to line up nicely with network pentesting, and I don't have a degree or any development experience. But with that said I'd really enjoy doing application security as a career.\n Does anyone have any advice in regards to entering the application security world from a support role? Or would it be better for me to pursue network security and then try to switch to application security later? \n Also should I pursue any certs that might help? I've thought about OSWE in the future.\n Any advice would be great, and again if this post doesn't belong here I can delete. Thanks.\n    submitted by    /u/n3v327311  \n [link]   [comments]",

I held sessions where we practiced (beginner) buffer overflows. \n While in school I had done research on hardware reverse engineering, focused on medical devices. \n That got me to present with my peers at our local bsides. I then was able to present at IEEE southeastcon, which got me a job as a security engineer before graduating. \n -----‐\n 1) Is it possible to get into exploit dev without a degree or is it absolutely necessary?\n 2) should I go the pentester route and then exploit dev?\n 3) do you see security engineers break into this field or does it tend to be developers? I don't do any software engineering, but I do a lot of tooling in powershell, python, and recently, go. I know C but hardly. \n 4) should I just shaddup and start learning?

We are putting a budget together (cellebrite's sales people are annoyingly hard to get in contact with) and we've got our prices ballparked and everything looks good except a computer build. We've talked with 2 other cellebrite users who both said they had to buy a $4-5k desktop build to work efficiently with cellebrite.\n I've built a pc before and have a basic knowledge about them, however I don't get these $4k+ build costs when all that's really necessary is an average build with an intell processor and a decent amount of ram. Besides that I have put in a good chunk of the budget to cover memory and additional hard drives to handle data/evidence. \n Are the other cellebrite users just getting railroaded by vendors selling them over priced pre-built models or is there something more to the build/requirements.\n Any advice would be greatly appreciated.\n    submitted by    /u/crimsontidepride  \n [link]   [comments]",

However, based on how little experience I have with PA, \"opening a case\" seems to just be a prompt to import extractions all over again. I thought about using \"project sessions\", but it seems to be something that you open after all the extractions are open that remembers what analysis you've done, not necessarily what devices you were working on.\n Can anyone speak to this?

Since here in Brazil you first need a CS degree to do a computer forensics course, I'm focused on finishing my CS course first for now.\n I looked at the FAQ here and got a lot of useful information, but I still have one that wasn't answered: what are the fields you can work? I know you can work in law enforcement and do forensics analysis to find digital evidence of a suspect (wich is most cases I belive), but can you work on the investigation field (like tracing criminals online)? If not, how do I work on this investigation field related to crimes online? Is computer forensics the best thing to study in this case?\n Another question is: on the private work field, how does it work? Do you work with data recovery stuff?\n I hope I don't annoy you with those questions, but I couldn't find them here yet!\n    submitted by    /u/silva-txt  \n [link]   [comments]",

It is a goal to rewrite this eventually and figure out a way of showing the duration, probably using an API of some kind. (my tool: https://csmit195.github.io/Links-to-XSPF-Web-App/)\n I have two files, one is 14.1k movies, and the other is 4.1k movies. My PC is fairly fast and loading the 14.1k movies took about 3mins, while the 4.1k only takes 10secs. Please test carefully with the 14.1k, some PC's might fail to load it, vlc could crash b4 finish loading.\n Downloads:\n note: the top 1.1k movies of both files are more popular than the ones below it\n 14.1K Movies (4.1K Movies from below included)\n https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gSjguuPTTyP_2oVktKD_YqbaAZStpEu4/view?usp=sharing\n 4.1K Movies\n https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dSb3d_CDbsvR7UO8nnnDBdYmJmsuBPv2/view?usp=sharing\n If you want more or have a really good source of direct movie links, feel free to lmk and I'll create more playlists. For now, enjoy and would love feedback (please no code reviews, I made it quickly so I can achieve this goal, wasn't really built for production, I'd love to optimise it in the future tho.\n Cheers,\n Chris\n    submitted by    /u/csmit195  \n [link]   [comments]",
