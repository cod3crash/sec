Given the pandemic, a lot of folks are working remote...a LOT. There are a number of firms that are international, with offices in a lot of different countries all over the world, and a great many of those folks are working remotely. Yes, we've always had remote workers and folks working outside of office environments, but the past 2+ years have seen something of a forced explosion in remote workers.\nThose remote workers are using laptops.\nAnd it's likely that they're not always connected to a power supply; that is, there will be tim…",

Both are thoughtful, cogent, and articulate.\nIn her blog post, Lina references detection techniques, something that is extremely important for all analysts to understand. What Lina is alluding to is the need for analysts to truly understand their tools, and how they work.\nBack around 2007-ish, the team I was on had several members (myself included) certified to work PCI forensic investigations. Our primary tool at the time for scanning acquired images and data for credit card numbers (CCNs) was EnCase (at the time, a Guidance Software product)...I believe version 6.19 or thereabouts.

          "description": "My previous post on this topic presented my thoughts on how the concept of \"artifact categories\" were being misused.\nMy engagement with artifact categories goes back to 2013, when Corey Harrell implemented his thoughts on categories via auto_rip. I saw, and continue to see, the value in identifying artifact categories, but as I alluded to in my previous post, it really seems that the categories are being misused. Where the artifacts should be viewed as providing an indication of the categories and requiring further analysis (including, but not limited to the population of artifact constellations), instead, the artifacts are often misinterpreted as being emphatic statements of the event or condition occurring. For example, while an entry in the ShimCache or AmCache.hve file should indicate …",

There are also times when we reduce those artifacts to a level where they're easier to understand, and in doing so, the categorization of the artifact isn't quite accurate. As such, it's necessary now and again to go back and take a look at that categorization to determine if still holds, or if it truly served the community in the manner intended.\nSPOILER ALERT - TL:DR \nWithin the DFIR community, we should not be hanging investigation findings on single artifacts in isolation.

          "description": "What, again?!?!\nI know, right?!?\nNot long ago, I read this fascinating article from Joe Helle that discussed malicious uses for Windows shortcuts, or LNK files, and also discussed a Python3 scripts called \"lnkbomb\".\nAs a side note, check out what Joe had to share about persistence via WSL2!\nAs anyone who's followed me for a minute knows, I love...L   O   V   E...me some LNK files. Shortcut files are something that we see all the time, have been around for a long time (much like ADSs), but folks in the DFIR field are so focused on the \"shiny hot newness\", that this file type is very often overlooked and not fully exploited.\nThe technique Joe discusses is similar to modifying the iconfilename field of a shortcut file, so that even if the \"bad guy\" is evicted from an infrastructure, any action that launches the LNK file results in credentials being passed via HTTP or WebDAV, where they can be collected, cracked, and then used by the threat actor.\nLNK files have a lot of uses, and understanding the format and structure is helpful in a lot of different ways. One example is that automatic JumpLists follow the OLE/structured storage format, and all but the DestList stream consist of LNK file formatted streams. Another example is that the building blocks of LNK files, shell items, are also the core building blocks of several Registry-based artifacts, such as shellbags.\nBeyond that, however, threat actors have used LNK files as lures in social engineering and phishing attacks; this means that the threat actor has built the LNK files within their own infrastructure, within their own development environment. As such, sending these files as lures is \"free money\" to both DFIR and CTI analysts, if they're able to leverage those files and their component metadata.\nSo...while I know Windows 11 is out, and everyone's excited about the shiny new hotness, let's not forget that there's a lot that has worked since Windows XP (or even prior to that) and still continues to be an issue today.",

Attribution has always been challenging, but has been and can continue to be eased through visibility.

Even adding information regarding infrastructure extracted from the sample configs can still give a somewhat limited view.

The first step in addressing a problem is admitting you have one. ;-)\nSeriously, though, this is simply to say that I have some experience, nothing more. During the latter part of my book writing experience, I saw others who wanted to do the same thing, but ran into a variety of roadblocks, roadblocks I'd long since navigated. As a result, I tried to work with the publisher to create a non-paid liaison role that would help new authors overcome many of those issues, so that a greater portfolio of quality books became available to the industry. By the time I convinced one editor of the viability and benefit of such a program, they had decided to leave their profession, and I…",

Interestingly enough, there wasn't this sort of reaction the second time the City of Baltimore got attacked, which (IMHO) belies the news cycle more than anything else.\nHowever, while the focus is on ransomware, for the moment, it's a good time to point out that there's more to this than just the attacks that get blasted across news feeds. That is, ransomware itself is an economy, an eco-system, which is a moniker that goes a long way to toward describing why victims of these attacks are impacted to the extent that they are.

First, there are different ways to create LNK files using the Windows API, and what's really cool is that each method has it's own unique #toolmarks associated with it!  \nSecond, most often there is a pretty good amount of metadata embedded in the LNK file structure.

          "description": "Hi HN,\nI've always been curious about bug hunting. Finding vulns. I have some foundational knowledge like fuzzing, basic web security and reading assembly, but I am also aware of all the improvements in software and web security and there are so many new tech stacks, languages and platforms these days. Where does one begin? Is it worth learning how to find memory safety vulns given how C and friends are dying (and when they are alive things like CFG and appguard make it impossible to exploit them)?\nAre there any modern books or sites you recommend? Should I be leaning some language (rust/go?) or stack (k8s?) as a prerequisite?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30324988\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 0",

These are the same machines over and over. It seems like one machine is targeting port 636 over TCP. It looks like an Nmap SYN scan Except that the initiating machine keeps changing the ports it uses while targeting one single port on the other machine.\n So it goes like this: X==Randomport\n A:X[SYN]>>B:636\n B:636[SYN, ACK]>>A:X\n A:X[ACK]>>B:636\n A:X[TLSv1 Client Hello]>>B:636\n B:636[RST, ACK]>>A:X\n Then it will repeat but X increments by 1.\n Anyone familiar with this type of pattern that can shed some light I have no idea what this even is. I know port 636 is ldap but I can’t figure out what the machine inquiring(A) is doing I don’t know any scans that actively target only one port.

Dom xss is one of those but today I watched a video on it that recommended reviewing the pages code and going through that method to discover Dom xss.\n Now to be clear what brought this on was a finding in burp, it's flagging on a JS file and from there location.hash data being passed to an element/value.\n What I could use some help with is understanding this type of Dom xss and how to validate this. I'm tired of not understanding this. My thought is that this js file has a vulnerable function and I should be looking for this function in use in the application somewhere.\n Oh also I'm not the most intelligent person and have no real experience with Javascript so it may be necessary to dumb some things down. And if there's a video that talks about this I would appreciate it.

Or does this relate to something else? \n Rather than this being the CCP having broken into my house, installed a custom CPU containing embedded backdoor access into my decade old gaming rig, I would think that this then probably relates more to major back-end backbone infrastructure stuff, which Huawei does a lot of, so is probably more along those lines?\n Any info appreciated.\n p.s. don't need to be told to use different email/PC/internet/security/OS, but I understand it's a natural reflex many of you can't control :D\n    submitted by    /u/JForce1  \n [link]   [comments]",

We did this with NIST CSF last year and found it useful, so we are now continuing on with 800-53.\n Currently, a coworker and I have a debate that I am going to lose, but would like to see if anyone smarter than me can provide a solid rebuttal.\n Here is the setup.\n We are determining if policy related to disabling or deleting an account maps to this control:\n  \nAC-2d.3. Access authorizations (i.e., privileges) and [Assignment: organization-defined attributes (as required)] for each account;\n  \nMy argument is:\n  \nDisabling an account disables the ability to authenticate to the account, but does not remove the previous authorization to the account. If someone subsequently enabled the account, the authorization would already exist, as its authorization did not change. Thus, policy around disabling an account is not considered for AC-2d.3. \n Deleting an account removes the account from the identity directory, which would also remove it from any authorizations associated with that account (assuming, of course, you have properly authorized the account using a tool that would also remove that authorization). Creating a new account with the same authorization would require authorizing the new account with the same authorization as the deleted account.

Anyone else, not based in China, have Little Snitch and can check to see if they have connections going to China with trustd?\n Little Snitch shows one of the China trustd IP addresses as:\n 110.188.2.1.\n The organisation owning this IP address is China Telecom Sichuan.\n The other 3 are:\n 111.43.160.66\n 112.92.99.203\n 120.240.74.66\n The US based trustd IP addresses are mostly 17.253.127.xxx, which are Apple owned (I think).\n FYI - per Little Snitch:\n \"Trust Daemon\" is a macOS system process that is responsible for evaluating the validity of digital certificates that are used for encryption and security features.\n \"trustd\" connects to the servers of several certificate authorities to evaluate the validity of digital certificates. If you deny these connections apps on your computer may not be able to connect to serves on the Internet.\n    submitted by    /u/idid2reddit  \n [link]   [comments]",

Considering the response is just for the client to see how does this effect the server at all? Is the server sometimes programmed to poll specific endpoint responses and serve a page based on that? If so is there any interesting way to simulate this behavior in a local environment as maybe a capture the flag? I wanna see why and how it works so I can continue to find them more in the wild it just never made sense to me. Like requests is obvious the server parses the input and does transformations sometimes reflects it etc but responses I have no clue why spoofing responses would work.\n    submitted by    /u/Academic-Discount252  \n [link]   [comments]",

I think the only advantage is that syn is faster to send in massive traffic.\n I didn't understand if today the famous OS like RedHat Linux, windows server, windows home, etc do limit the backlog by default or not. I saw different sources say different things.Usually, organizations manually limit the TCP backlog (I know it depends), or just trust third-party systems like Big-IP of F5?\n IP and port spoofing is necessary for the attack?

My biggest struggle is dealing with too many clients in a short timespan, and having work follow me after hours.

I am interested in whether the GIAC GDSA or the CCNP Security is a more valuable investment. There's not too much information on the GDSA that I can find, and through my research, I have found people recommending to do the CCNP R&S before going to CCNP Security back when it was under a different format.

Some are obvious on how to deal with, but some are harder, and I wondered if I could get some insight on what the process you guys would follow is for these?\n For example, one of our laptops on the remote VPN is triggering a IPS alert - 'TCP Segment Overwrite'\n I google the text and I see that \"This signature fires when one or more TCP segments in the same stream overwrite data from one or more segments located earlier in the stream. This may indicate an attempt to hide an attack.\" and also \"Overwriting TCP segments does not normally occur and should be treated with suspicion\"\n OK, sounds suspicious? So I run an AV scan, and the machine comes up clean. So where would I go from here?\n Disclaimer, I'm no \"Mr Robot\" lol. I can understand TCPdump in terms of tracing where a packet is going and which interface it goes in / out etc but when it comes down to analysing packet contents etc with Wireshark, well..my abilities just don't stretch that far :(\n I always seem to hit this brick wall with a lot of IPS alerts where I'm just sat thinking, I don't know exactly what's causing it so I can't say it's a false positive or not.

Since I couldn't decide in what domain of IT I wanted to pursue my learning path (because everything interests me in IT), I went into cyber security since it's pretty much the IT domain that includes all the IT domains. I did TryHackMe's Pre Security path and now I'm almost done with the Jr Pentester path. I'm planning to do the Blue Team path. I also do CTFs to practice along. At this point I suppose that if this field was not for me I would've known by now, but so far I love it. I want to become a Blue Teamer\n Now I'm reading here and there on Reddit that it's impossible to start in cybersec for a beginner because you need real IT experience for instance years as a software/network engineer. Back when I started learning, people told me that I just needed Lab practice and Certifications and then boom I could apply for entry level jobs in cybersec. I wanted to get my foot in the door by starting as a Help Desk and then as a Sys Admin, mastering the fundamentals is obviously mandatory so I know I can't just start as a Blue Team Expert, but do I really need to be a network engineer for multiple years to then have enough XP to enter cybersec's (cybersex) field ?

I’ve been reading about the topic, which I’m finding fascinating, but it’s also left me with some questions about when to fuzz and which flavour of fuzzing would make sense for the large number of services/APIs in our portfolio.\n -At which phase does fuzzing get in the picture? Is this something typically run later as in QA and deployment/release or post-commit/build similar to SAST? Would the latter scenario be redundant given we run SAST?\n -How agile is black box and grey box (instrumentation guided) fuzzing for an app portfolio with a rapidly changing attack surface? \n I’m leaning towards black-box mutation and template fuzzers since the attack surface can be supplied via a network traffic capture, API specification…all of which are easily retrievable from other tools in our QAT/AST framework. \n My understanding is grey box fuzzers require user programmed harness classes to interface with the app. Meaning every time a new entry point is added or removed or a new app is onboarded, the fuzzer needs an updated setup. Afaik this setup is done manually at least for all the open-source grey box fuzzers I’ve looked into.\n Any gotchas or recommendations on fuzz testing adoption strategy are much appreciated.\n    submitted by    /u/phuckphuckety  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hey folks,\n I'm learning about DDoS attacks, and I see a lot of ICMP floods, UDP floods, HTTP floods, etc.\n At the end of the day, the attacker sends Ethernet frames to the victim server and its network, so if we look only at how it affects the bandwidth of server or network devices, there isn't any.\n In my point of view, it's can only help to pass some obstacles. For example, the Firewall blocks ICMP requests, but not HTTP because it legitimate requests from a web server like Amazon.\n Maybe the difference can be significant if we talk about exhausting CPU and RAM because probably HTTP GET or POST can require the server to do a lot more than ICMP protocol.\n I get it right or totally messed up something?\n Thanks.\n    submitted by    /u/Webly99  \n [link]   [comments]",

(like i never learnt it in advance level)\n  \nWhat is the study path?\n What's the best country to shift to for studies? (Thinking of Canada/US/UK)\n Is it necessary for me to start from scratch like doing a certificate > diploma > degree > masters or whatever?\n Sites/platforms where I could study things related to the field?\n How badly is it going to affect me with the switch since it is all new?\n What are the pros and cons of getting into this field?\n Any other advice or suggestions that comes to your head. :)\n  \nEdit : One more point I would like to add after seeing the comment from this guy; What's the study path and career path for Hardware hacking? \n Thank you so much!

Then interview again\n The problem is that i have a military service in 4 months,and it’s obligated. Currently i am studying Mike Myers on Udemy for networks+ i read some refrence books sometimes. And when i finish it i will start building my own network lab on gns3. \n For the practical side i am practicing on hackthebox,just ranked from noob to script kiddie. I still read writeups a lot and get stuck after i find a vulnerability or sometimes even at enumeration. \n My question is that,did you ever grind and work hard to achieve bigger outcomes in shorter time? I feel like i should study more ,i mean like i should stay up all night 2 days a week to finish all of that . And i feel like i should spend almost all of my day hacking. Sure i can go out for an hour or two ,but that is that. I fear i will have a burnout but i also fear that i will keep learning basic stuff and take me forever to land a job. I want to be a pro and i know it’s fucking hard but this is my passion since i used to create RATS during high school. I feel i should give it everything i have.

          "description": "Hi everyone! I'm a 23 year old Web Dev (working for 3 years). Few mouth ago I decided that I wanted to change the direction of my career and get into cyber security. \n My ultimate goal or a dream job in security would be probably to become a penetration tester that works with a team of experts on getting into businesses through the network vunrebilities, services misconfiguration or physically by phishing, social engineering and trying to get in the building (of course legally)\n I recon it's a very specialised job and definitely not an entry level but I think it's important to mention the end goal to get the whole picture.\n I researched a lot about becoming a pentester. I spend my time on TryHackMe as well as rooted some retired machines on HackTheBox of course using Kali, yet, I feel I lack A LOT of knowledge and credibility, so here lies my problem.\n I fell into a rabbit hole of googling \"which cert is the best\", \"how to become X\", \"best way to Y\". So rather than digging deeper and deeper I figured I'll just ask my own questions.\n  \nOf course, what certs should I get? \n OSCP is an obvious answer, but I don't feel like I'm ready, also I never got a cert in my life AND it's pretty expensive (I'm not even gonna mention SANS)\n Sec+ and Net+ are great intro certs but they don't really help with HR and I'm not sure if my web experience is enough for me. I feel like a have an okay grasp on network and security concepts.\n \neJPT and eCCP learn you a lot, but are even less recognized by HR than CompTIA ones\n \nIsn't it better to take a step back and first try to become a SOC or sysadmin? Preferably Linux sysadmin\n \nShould I just concentrate on HTB, start a blog, get a PEN-200 and push for OSCP? Isn't it too risky?\n \n PS. Im planing on moving to Germany so I also spend time learning the language and I have 7 mouth before a move out. I set myself a goal to get my Netsec job there.\n I hope what I said makes sense.\n    submitted by    /u/Anvvir  \n [link]   [comments]",

I sent a file that is actually an endless \"while\" loop.\n This means Dos attack is every way of denying service by making the server use too many resources.\n 2. I sent a file that actually stops all the services/processes every five seconds.\n This means DoS attack is actually every way of denying a service.\n 3. I just sending a lot of ethernet frames in different ways (ping, HTTP, whatever).\n This means Dos attack is every way of denying a service only by massive requests amount.\n ** I know it's kind of ridiculous, but if it's actually any way of denying service, would you also consider someone that physically disconnected the server cables as Dos attack?\n ** If the definition is number 1, 2 machines that sent the same file - considered already as DDoS?\n Thanks!\n ​\n BTW, is there an official list of the most common Dos/DDos attacks types in the last years?\n    submitted by    /u/Webly99  \n [link]   [comments]",

I don't use cPanel for much and don't know all that much about it. I forgot about a WordPress site I was running and someone got it and was able to then compromise the cPanel login. Shame on me for letting a WordPress site sit vulnerable, I know. But it happens. They were then able to get into cPanel. So they loaded up a few WordPress sites with phishing site stuff, and also sent out some phishing emails, all pretty standard stuff I've seen before. Lots of base64 php files and other standard WP hack php stuff.\n Something I hadn't seen before happened when I SSHed into the server, and I'm not sure what it was or what they had running. I logged in and immediately saw an error that I don't exactly remember, but it was a normal looking error about \"no shell\", I couldn't do anything, it was just an empty shell. None of the standard commands worked. So I logged in, and something caught my session and had me in... I don't know what. I did ctrl-d or maybe ctrl-c and was back to the normal shell on that server. Things looked normal again. I wasn't even sure I was on the server at first, so I didn't capture the exact errors I was seeing before the return to normal. One thing that I did notice was the title of my session in iterm2 had changed to what looked like a list of files on the server with ^M in between the names. So, something like access-logs^M^application-backups^M^dbs^M^ and so on, all the root level directories. By the time I gave it any thought, I had already cleaned up most everything and killed a couple of running processes. \n Any idea what I got into when I logged in to there?\n    submitted by    /u/blakesterz  \n [link]   [comments]",

Beyond feeling bad, it is creepy that other people view and use my personal information without permission. \n In order to prevent access to phishing sites and prevent personal information from being leaked, it is necessary to check if the domain is normal when receiving e-mails or text messages containing links. \n So I want to ask.\n What is a way to verify that it is a normal domain when receiving mail and text messages containing links?\n Is there a service or system that determines a link to a web page normal or dangerous when i enter suspicious link to search box?\n    submitted by    /u/Late_Ice_9288  \n [link]   [comments]",

So e.g., a lookup to *.microsoft.com would be recursively resolved, but not a lookup to *.evildomain.com.\n When Google searching for ways to mitigate DNS tunneling, this is not a commonly suggested countermeasure.

In my mind I'm thinking so how is this a phishing email if there is nothing suspicious in it.

I'm a beginner Networking & Security student so I'm not that unfamiliar with stuff, I don't have anything hosted other than a VPN, and I'm using a consumer grade router that's not capable of VLANs, and other good stuff.\n I may be just a little paranoid but I've been noticing a lot of blocked IP requests from Russia in the security log for my router. Almost 50% of what I found in the log for February 27 is from over there. One of the IPs I found had 32 hits, another had just 9. Coming in second is the US, then there's Switzerland, Germany, Lithuania. From just the couple foreign IPs that I looked up using https://www.abuseipdb.com/, all of them were flagged for high confidence of abuse.\n I don't have anything against those countries but I was wondering what all that's going on if I should be more concerned than usual. I'd just like my computer and data to remain in once piece.\n Not sure if I should be saying anything else about my setup on a public post here but could appreciate some advice. Only tech guy in my family so can't ask anyone else.\n I'm considering just disabling the VPN so I don't have any more open ports, and using iCloud Private Relay or something else when I'm out. \n I'm aware of Pfsense, and I was considering it, but I just don't want to spend $$$ with inflation, chip shortages, and who knows what else.\n Anyway thanks in advance.\n    submitted by    /u/Expensive-Exit6398  \n [link]   [comments]",

This lets you escalate from a guest user all the way to super admin. Now lets say they patch this in a lot of cases you can password spray a random user and find a post auth file read and now instead of an auth bypass its more of an authorization bypass now your a normal user but can read admin areas and admin log files that may have juicy stuff.

Im not comfortable providing my SSN over email and one of my employers told me that was okay and i can give the employer in charge of it a call.\n I emailed the employee and she told me that she will be in a meeting until the day ends and if i could leave my SSN through voicemail and she will delete the message once the meeting is over and will run the ssn through the database. she told me she couldnt do tommorow since she was leaving out of country and i need to give it before monday on the day i start to have results checked\n is this safe to leave a voicemail with my ssn since though she will delete it afterwards? seems it my only option or should i just forget this job altogether if this is my only choice or request someone else who is available to do it with? i think she is the only one.....\n update : i decided to do it since time was ticking since i start Monday and the employer is off to another country tomorrow so i wont be able to connect with her, which i find very weird. Did i put myself at risk?? probably. Did i feel immediate regret after doing it? Yes i did. nervous as heck, i hope i will be fine after this.\n    submitted by    /u/lostspirit10  \n [link]   [comments]",

We chat for a bit, I'm in his loungeroom on his couch for a an hour or so. At one point early on I mention that I am downloading a large file onto my phone. He asks if I want to use his Wi-Fi, and I accept. When I'm connecting, he convinces me to use my phone MAC address. Okay. I try to browse the Internet while I wait but the connection is garbage. I recieve a text from our other friend who wants to buy weed off me. He immediately ushers me out the door despite suggestions of a Round 2 earlier. \n Later that night, I notice that when posting to my Instagram, all the recent photos are my bodychecks.

          "description": "I'm somewhat new to idevice admin, so please excuse any ignorance.\n Is it possible to route literally ALL packets from an iPhone through a VPN? We're trying to get some stuff set up and we implemented a VPN by way of a user-installable app. Unfortunately it seems that on iOS there are a lot of connections that bypass this. For example when first connected to a wifi network the iPhone spams a flurry of connections to Apple's servers which don't go through the VPN. I've confirmed this by creating an \"evil\" wifi network that supports ipv4 only and blocks any connections to the 17.x.x.x range (which is wholly owned and operated by Apple), and even with the VPN active the logs show hundreds of connection attempts persistently. If I also block all Apple domains then half the stuff on the phone no longer works. App-based connections are routed correctly (Safari, etc), but the phone completely ignores the VPN for both DNS lookups and the connections themselves when it comes to system stuff and I'm not sure why.\n From my research it seems that maybe we need to ditch the app idea and instead implement an \"always on\" VPN by way of a mobileconfig file. This appears to require the iPhones to be supervised through MDM, which isn't a problem. I've taken a test phone, wiped and supervised it, but I'm having trouble figuring out how to create a mobileconfig that does what we want. Before I burn too many hours messing with this I'm wondering if anyone can help with the following two questions:\n  \nWill an \"always on\" VPN on an iPhone actually route ALL packets through the VPN (including the system level phone-home initialization stuff, DNS lookups, ntp, etc) or is this not even the right approach?\n \nAssuming (1) is the correct approach, can someone point me to an example mobileconfig file that implements this so I can look at the structure and have a better idea of what I'm doing?\n \n    submitted by    /u/sneakertech  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I had this idea on how to generate supposedly safe passwords for different websites/accounts that wouldn't require passwords to be memorized or stored.\n The idea is to \n 1 - Come up with a short default string that would never change (say, \"bubly42\")\n 2 - Append the name of the website to that string for each website you make an account. For example, when creating an account for airbnb it'd produce the string \"bubly42airbnb\"\n 3 - Run that string (bubly42airbnb) through a hash function\n 4 - Use the output of the hash function as the password for the website\n This would have the upside of not requiring memorization or storage of passwords, while still generating a unique password for each site. I can just generate the password on the fly. Obvious downside is that if someone figures your pattern out, they pretty much can figure out all of your passwords.\n Is there anything else that I'm missing?

I've raised this with TG's tech support who have repeatedly denied that any such behavior exists. I'm seeing this consistently on 4 windows machines (including one VM) where I have TG running.\n I'm not sure where to report this as there is no TG subreddit and the VPN subreddit doesn't allow mentioning specific services. Hopefully you folks can point me in the right direction or give advice.\n So, if the app is running and the VPN is connected, even if there are no other apps open, TG client will randomly begin consuming a constant 50% CPU. I can't correlate this with any other condition like network traffic or other app activity or any obvious thing TG is doing. If I minimize the TG client window, it stops. And then it starts again in a few minutes, and so I repeat this remedy, and it stops. If I don't do this it continues indefinitely. So, every computer this is running on experiences a significant heat/wattage increase and CPU performance degradation due to TG.\n I took screenshots of this behavior using task manager. I also watched it using winternals' process monitor, which gave much more detailed info than this. ---- But this forum doesn't allow pictures.\n    submitted by    /u/Dougolicious  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi Netsec people!\n Every once in a while I will get emails saying that some website/service I’m registered on has reset my password because of too many failed log in attempts.\n Now I’m not too surprised by the attempts, since according to HaveIBeenPwned, my credentials have been ‘exposed’ over 30 times in breaches dating back to the early 2010s. However, a while back I gave up my terrible practice of using 1 password across multiple services and migrated to using a password manager, and now all of my passwords to every service I’m on are randomly generated, so I’m not too worried by these attempts.\n My question is this: Why does the most common practice seem to be for services to reset your password after a few failed attempts?\n To me that seems like if x log in attempts failed, the password was robust/held up—why force the user to change it? If the user used a random generator, repeated tries that are time separated (I.e. wait 10min before trying again) probably won’t get an attacker anywhere.\n If a person isn’t using a password manager/generator then forcing the user to reset might actually lead them to use a weaker password since they will have to come up with something familiar, and there are only so many familiar items a person can keep track of at a time…\n I’d love to hear some insights on to why this reset after x tries approach appears to be such a pervasive (and counterintuitive) practice!\n Sorry if this isn’t the right place for a question like this!\n    submitted by    /u/KrishanuAR  \n [link]   [comments]",

Like a lot of these central programs it continued for a few months and then was quickly forgotten about. Now I've been tasked with setting up our own version in the division as the central version is pretty much dead but they're still pushing the general idea.\n This is what is currently on my list\n - Security champions to be Security+ certified (I know it's a broad basic cert but I figure we can get funding for this and then progress to more advanced targeted training)\n - Add a method into Jira for tracking security related issues separately\n - Create discrete security projects as epics so we can fix some of the legacy issues completely and not worry about them anymore (current ideas for these include: removing third party services to reduce exposure, updating some very old libraries, updating SQL user security etc)\n Any other ideas of things I could introduce?\n    submitted by    /u/dbxp  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello AskNetSec!\n I am curious what you all would consider an appropriate response to an incident such as a user reporting that they've clicked on a phishing link.\n Personally, I believe it is appropriate to probe about what popped up after clicking the link, whether or not they entered any of their information, and whether or not they notice any abnormal behavior on their computer after clicking on the link. After that, have the user change their password as a precaution and move on begin monitoring.\n I figure between the questions assuring they did nothing more than click, a password change, existing security controls such as CrowdStrike, and monitoring for abnormal behavior, there isn't much more that makes sense to do. Others on my team seem to think it's worth downloading Microsoft Safety Scanner and running a full system scan, which I argue doesn't hurt, but also probably doesn't add much value unless something is seen on the user's computer that would prompt further investigation. Especially since I can't imagine Microsoft Safety Scanner is going to pick up on something that CrowdStrike does not.\n Understandably, different companies may expect different responses based on established policy and regulations. But I want to leave it kind of open ended and see what other IT and security professionals believe is appropriate for these types of incidents?

One of the big project I'm currently running alone is the architecting and deployment of MFA across all employees and all our divisions + deployment of a new VPN solution for employees, with Multi Factor Authentication on every VPN connection. My biggest duties outside of projects are threat detection and response, training and security awareness to employees, and patching old and vulnerable systems. \n I think I was lucky to find a security role with no prior security experience, but I feel like I'm underpaid.

If not, please direct me to the appropriate one.\n Questions:\n  \nIf I use LLMNR or IPv6 DNS Poisoning and get the NTLM hash of a local admin, I can use that hash or the cracked password to access the machine he's an admin on. If I manage to fetch the hash of a domain admin, I can log into any machine on the domain including the domain controller. What can I do if I get hash of a lowly domain user? I cannot log into any machine. Can I still authenticate against the DC to get infos like users, policies, etc?\n \nDoes it make a difference if I only have the hash or the cracked password?\n \nIf we are only a regular domain user all we can do to escalate our privileges is kerberoasting, correct? Like, we can't do pass the hash / pass the password because we can't get any from a machine. And we can't do token impersonation because, again, we can't get onto any machine.\n \n I want to thank everyone in advance for answering any of these questions. Please correct me if I misunderstood anything. I'm really new to AD pentesting.\n    submitted by    /u/placeholderbagholder  \n [link]   [comments]",

The basic principle is that the key embodies a secret that is shared between the lock and the key, and the same principle underlies possession factor authentication in computer systems. A security token is an example of a possession factor. \n  \nOne could argue that the device itself could count as a possession.

I usually go over the pdf to pick up some new tricks and move on.\n After full day of work and family I don't even know when to find 2-3 days straight to do the exam. I still don't understand why Offsec doesn't change the exams to 5 days and let people do it like it's done in a real world instead of putting unnecessary pressure with ctf style exam time frame.\n Also when I took OSCP exam I didn't have to deal with being monitored.

The problem is I think I'll have a lot of stigma going into interviews as it will be very obvious I couldn't handle netsec and am looking for an out, especially considering as I'm on £50k and will likely need to take a cut down to 25k-35k to get into a role like this.\n So any advice anyone can offer for how to approach this situation? Do I need to go get an entirely different set of certs before I'll even be considered?\n signed, \n a very burnt out pentester\n    submitted by    /u/mekkr_  \n [link]   [comments]",

What im wondering is if theres anything anagalous like this in other popular languages like php ruby on rails django etc to do the same thing and if not is there any research regarding auth bypasses for open redirects which are more client side based and I don’t believe they can be used for auth bypasses since forwards are internal/server sided and keep session and parameter data intact where as redirects are client sided and initialize fresh session data so they seem less useful then forwards. The only time ive seen an open redirect possibly bypass authentication is in combination with a ssrf or some feature where the web app follows the url and then follows that urls redirect internally.

          "description": "Backstory for question: I'm currently on the process of getting a job and I was sent a link (via email) to a psychological test which required a username and password to login, the user was already typed for me (sent as parameter on the url) and the password was sent on the email. At first I didn't read the full email so I entered the link and when I saw I needed a password, I thought that there must've been a mistake, so I typed a \"random\" password to see what would happen (I typed the same user as the pass) and I was able to log in. I was very confused as I was greeted with a page full of information regarding the account I was logged in to and as I explored further I was able to see personal information regarding other people that have done the quiz. At this point I realized that I wasn't supposed to be able to read this info so I logged out and tried another password (I was thinking that maybe the account accepted everything you typed) but no, I got a \"wrong password\" text. I read the email again, this time I saw that the password I was supposed to use was always there, I try it and I log in succesfully, but now it doesn't redirect me to the admin panel, it takes me to the psych test I'm supposed to be doing. As a NetSec Student, I know that I should let the company know about this weak password, but I don't know how to do it without it looking like I was on purpose trying to log in with another password different than the one provided via email and maybe get in trouble with the company I'm applying to.\n Worded as a question: What is the best way to let a company know that they have a vulnerability on an account?\n TL;DR: Got sent user and pass for an account, tried same user as pass instead (because I'm dumb and didn't read full email) and logged in as admin.

Our first commercial release (\"Minimum Marketable Product\") should happen around September 2022.\n We are about ten people, half of them developers. Everything is in the cloud. We have a Chief Architect who is a very mature professional. \n I don't have an IT background, but as we'd like to work with enterprises and other security-minded organizations, I am considering obtaining certification for standards like ISO27001 and/or SOC 2 (Type I and II). \n Is it a reasonable ambition to start this process as soon as our MVP is out (next month), or it's more realistic to wait until our product and team gains more maturity? \n If we have to pick, e.g. due to budget constraints, would you recommend to pursue ISO27001 or SOC 2?\n tl;dr: For a very young startup, what is the best time to start working on compliance and certifications? \n Thank you!\n    submitted by    /u/brunotoronto  \n [link]   [comments]",

Whenever I message people at work or they message me they always leave dots at the end of a lot of the things they are saying. I have gotten dozens of messages saying \"Hello...\". It is not a typo either there is no way it could be.

They tell us they want to start roles at 85% of the grade for the band which is around $70k-$80k. The role requires 5 years of IT exp with 2+ of Security.\n They claim they have done research but wont share their evidence stating the role is graded properly. It doesnt seems to align with what I have been seeing for other jobs, what people are asking for, or what I found on NIST NICE.\n what resources are out there to help identifying compensation for roles in cyber by industry (i.e. e-commerce, higher ed, govt, etc).

My current role is within IT operations as a systems engineer, but it's possibly evolving to be the first true role with an official information security component within the IT department at my company. I'm excited because I've always enjoyed the security aspects of my roles over my career, and my formal education was focused on information security. However, I recognize that I have no formal work experience in a security-specific role, and as such I feel like I'm \"winging it\".\n I don't really know what a formalized incident response looks like within an established security department. I don't know what tools I have at my disposal, or should have at my disposal, to do my job effectively. I also realize that I may be overthinking it. But truthfully, I have no point of reference.\n So I come to you all and ask for some opinions and insights to navigate as the sole person with these newly added responsibilities that I would liken to a security analyst, and do so in a way that makes sense and is effective. I'm happy to do my own reading and self-learning (I have access to PluralSight, if that would be useful), but also hoping maybe someone with experience can give some practical pointers and/or high-level procedural advice since I will likely be shaping this new role in coordination with my management.\n Thank you all in advance!\n Edited because my brain moved faster than my fingers could type :(\n    submitted by    /u/unseenspecter  \n [link]   [comments]",

Feel free to direct me to another subreddit.\n After installing the beta version 7B86vAG4 of the BIOS for my MSI B450-A PRO motherboard, Secure Boot silently stopped working. That is, it boots any OS, for example, the Arch Linux installation medium. I see this behavior with factory default Secure Boot keys which likely are MSI's and Microsoft's keys and with my own keys. But keys shouldn't matter since the Arch Linux installation medium isn't signed by anybody:\n  \nThe official installation image does not support Secure Boot (FS#53864). To successfully boot the installation medium you will need to disable Secure Boot.\n  \nsource\n I reverted to the version 7B86vAD where Secure Boot works as expected.\n The last reply from the MSI support was:\n  \nI: I do not use Windows at all.\n Support: Generally speaking, the secure boot won't take effect if you system cannot be supported. Please don't worry about it. Thanks!\n  \nWell, I don't think I shouldn't worry about that. Secure Boot should work irrespective of the OS in this case since the OS isn't even booted. There are many people using Secure Boot with Linux.\n I would like to know whether this is just my motherboard or I set up Secure Boot incorrectly.

          "description": "Three months ago I received a newsletter from AltCoinTrader.co.za on my Gmail inbox. However, I never signed up for this site. I initially brushed it off for peace of mind. But I keep getting scared every time I remember it so I wanted to finish it by contacting the sites support and ask if my email was ever registered with them. To my horror, they said that someone did register but did not activate the account in May 2020. However, I could not find an activation email in my inbox, which has me worried that someone does have access to it and deleted it before I could see it. It is unlikely to be me since I wrote an email around the same time and other useless emails at that time period are still there.\n I have switched PCs since May 2020, but have kept my phone. My Gmail also has a new password + 2FA now. However, the new PC did share the same network briefly with my old PC. I very recently re-opened my old PC and did a thorough malware scan. Unfortunately, it found 3 Trojans. Current PC has had a clean bill of health so far. Problem is I have done very sensitive stuff on that PC from credit card details, SSN, online banking passwords, and, worst of all, confidential information for my work, including customers' personal data. \n I still don't know if I should treat this as a confirmed hack and/or full-on panic. Aside from this anomaly and the Trojans, the only other weird thing is my phone keeps logging account activity by itself sometimes (which I assume is it just pinging Google servers). Apart from that none of my accounts showed any signs of compromise. I also consulted someone earlier who said the Trojans could possibly be unrelated. And it is unclear what the motive is for someone to use someone else's email for crypto trading and log in to the account only to delete the confirmation email.\n Please help me with this. This is so strange, and a lot is at stake if I was compromised. I might actually get hospitalized over the stress from this.\n    submitted by    /u/WrestleMaykr  \n [link]   [comments]",

Either way, I am still a target.\n I need to put a VM on my machine (if thats the best way to do this, if not please say so), or multiple VM's.\n I need to know which VM to use, and how to make it so that if I do get malware on my VM, which I would be using all the time, it will not be able to pass through and attach itself on to my host machine. How exactly is this possible, and what settings do I need to set, what Linux distro should I use, and will I be safe using the business software which is Win10 only on a VM?

I am currently writing a report and within the report format, \"reverse engineering\" and \"disassembly\" are two different sections. This doesn't really make much sense to me. Disassembly is already a form of reverse engineering. Nevertheless, the information that you could insert into an RE section would be Wireshark analysis, viewing the file in PEStudio for instance, but those are already in sections relating to static & dynamic analysis. \n So what would be inserted into a reverse engineering section regarding malware? I can literally only think of unpacking the malware as everything else that would constitute reverse engineering is in other sections. Honestly, I have no idea. When I asked for some help in regards to knowing the distinction between the two, I was told that \"disassembly\" is a noun, and \"reverse engineering\" is a verb. Which is probably right, but it didn't help at all. An example of breaking encryption was proposed in relation to RE. Again, it didn't shed much light for me.\n I just want to be familiar with the distinction here. Thanks.\n    submitted by    /u/pat0000  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi, I'm currently learning about c and the classic vulnerabilities that arise. Right now buffer overflows\n ​\n So, just to sum up my understanding, an example like this will overflow because 'ab' is of two bytes is too big to store in the last byte of \"buff\":\n char buff[10]; \n buff[9] = 'ab';\n The wiki article about buffer overflows define them as follows:\n  \n\"while writing data) to a buffer, overruns the buffer's boundary\"\n  \nThis got me thinking that this sounds a lot like integer overflows. Trying to put something into a container that it cannot contain.\n But let's take the following example of a integer overflow (I use unsigned char for having most simple case):\n unsigned char c = 255; \n unsigned char cc = c + 1;\n Ok, so the single byte of the char cannot contain a value higher than 255, and thus it does modulo.\n And my understanding of integer overflow is that internally, the computer tries to put a 1 to the left of the current numbe, such that if 255 looks like this:\n 11111111 \n then it simply assumes that there exists a place that represents 256, and tries to create this binary number:\n 100000000 \n But there is no such bit, and therefore the number just becomes 00000000.\n But the single 1 that is lost doesnt that go somewhere in memory?\n For that reason, my thought was that integer overflows had have to also contain buffer overflows. \n Is this true?\n ​\n Further thoughts\n At the core of the issue is a question of what actually constitutes a buffer in c.\n You could maybe argue that this problem would have been better suited for r/learnprogramming.\n But yeah, my guess is that it depends on whether or not a certain variable counts as buffers.\n is a int a buffer? is a char[]? etc?\n    submitted by    /u/GarseBo  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello everyone,\n I'm currently implementing a DNSSEC validator (at https://github.com/qdm12/dns). It's working so far, but most zones aren't signed (even google.com it seems). How is a DNSSEC validator meant to handle unsigned cases?\n Should it just let it through without any validation? Or should it check somewhere else if a zone is meant to be signed? Or should we patiently wait for DNSSEC to be more widely adopted?\n I'm wondering for example in the case an attacker hacks an authoritative nameserver like Cloudflare's 1.1.1.1 and returns bad records without their previously existing RRSIG signatures. A DNSSEC validator (without caching or on a cold boot) will not detect the bad records from Cloudflare right?\n Thanks in advance!\n    submitted by    /u/dowitex  \n [link]   [comments]",

I found two ideolegies for that, one being hands on experience and the other being strong basics. However that only gave me more questions.\n First: what is \"Hands-on experience\" ?

Anything we should be careful about? The process seems quite complicated.\n How much time will it take?\n Technically how is this different from option a?

Is it possible to separate my home network into 3 smaller networks with seperate SSID's that won't communicate between eachother (basically what I'm asking is it possible to have separate networks for guests and me ?\n ​\n I would have some IoT devices such as a smart TV but is it possible to filter it out in ACL so that the TV only has LAN but can't connect to the internet ?\n Since I'm moving out it will be a great learning experience to make my home network.

Which model is the best, should I go for OpenWRT ?\n Should I get a L3 switch ?

          "description": "Hello !\n ​\n I am currently applying (learning purpose) the following tutorial about a ROP-based buffer overflow inside my Kali VM: https://www.dailysecurity.fr/return_oriented_programming/\n ​\n However i m unable to reproduce the same behavior and get a shell...\n ​\n I m currently debugging with Peda GDB and have seen strange things such as a SIGSEGV fault.\n ​\n I m a beginner and don't feel comfortable with some points:\n - does my EIP during the SIGSEGV is correct ? It looks like to be not in vmmap ranges (0x7... instead of 0x8...).\n - Moreover \"Leak scanf\" has a strange value interpreted as string \"JHmp\"\n - Why there are values in my stack between gadget_pop_ebx and /bin/bash instead of just padding+leak_system+gadget_pop_ebx+leak_binsh ?\n - When invoking \"Leak system\" with \"SHELL=/bin/bash\" does it work with prefix \"SHELL=\" ? Or need another string ?\n - In comments someone said he had an issue with scanf interpreting space 0x20 but after checking address I think I m not concerned. Just maybe \"Leak scanf\" has 0x0a in the address could generate an error ?\n ​\n Could you help me to understand why it doesn't work ?\n I have attached screenshots with values of the stack, registers, etc to help your understanding (The GDB break is located to the RET of vuln() function to follow the ROP chain with the overwriting of \"saved eip\")\n ​\n Many thanks !!\n ​\n Update:\n ​\n I have updated my libc and it works fine now... Still don't understand why it didn't work before.\n ​\n Screenshots:\n https://ibb.co/VmGxwC4\n https://ibb.co/SPy5jNb\n https://ibb.co/PmMRbf0\n https://ibb.co/3vHkT9Q\n    submitted by    /u/Oni_Nephilim  \n [link]   [comments]",

I was checking the console of my macbook for any access events or really anything at all just in case and I saw these logs from August (~7-12 days before the hack on Sept 2nd) that look like reference to some update and looks like an iPhone is possibly involved? Not sure. \n The vector was likely a file on my computer (not online) holding seed phrases.\n I didn't update my iPhone or connect my iPhone to my macbook to update at any point during that timeframe as far as I can remember. \n Is it possible someone on a shared network could use an iPhone to somehow access private files and data on my macbook? Or otherwise, any idea what these console events could be regarding?\n I am already working with US secret service on the actual tracking of the stolen crypto funds. We were not able to find the vector of the breach of private data however. Wondering if this is info that is a clue?\n Imgur\n Thanks\n    submitted by    /u/Intel81994  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Greetings everyone in r/asknetsec,\n I hope everyone is doing well and getting ready for the holidays. All the moderators here wish you a relaxing and safe time with your families and friends. Hopefully we all will get a breather from the crazy world of Cyber Security and Networking.\n A couple of updates right off the bat –\n  \nWe’ve noticed an uptick in traffic for the subreddit over the past couple of months. Page views are up roughly 35% since the all-time lows of June-July when the subreddit was locked from the original admin. We are very happy with the increase, as it allows more collaboration and questions to be answered.\n Survey requests are no longer accepted on the subreddit going forward. We had a bit of a conversation internally on this topic as they seem to come up once or twice a week. Usually these are from college students requesting information for a class or study. We wish to continue and help anyone in school to best of our ability, but most of the time these surveys results are not shared publicly, and only benefit the survey creator. Due to this we don’t see it beneficial to include them. We’ve added surveys to rule 2 of what is relevant to the subreddit.\n Going into the new year, we hope to start providing everyone with some AMAs from verified industry professionals. We’ve been talking about this internally for a bit.\n  \nState of the subreddit posts will most likely continue once every quarter (3 months). Thanks to everyone for continuing to contribute to the subreddit and continuing to report posts that break the rules. Even if you are unsure, your reports are appreciated.\n Have a fantastic holiday, and if you need anything, don’t hesitate to reach out to us directly.\n -AskNetSec Mod Team\n    submitted by    /u/Envyforme  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "ntlmrelayx2proxychains aims to connect the tool of the SecureAuthCorps' impacket suite, ntlmrelayx.py (hereafter referred to as \"ntlmrelayx\"), along with @byt3bl33d3r's tool, CrackMapExec (hereafter referred to as \"CME\"), over proxychains, developped by haad.\n Currently, when having active relays via ntlmrelayx.py, you need to manually provide user, domain, and ip address in CME over proxychains. The idea behind this tool is to automate this process.\n So have you ever felt too lazy to explore all shares, loggedin users, sessions, disks, and/or password policy manually after using ntlmrelayx or felt too lazy to dump the lsa, sam, and/or ntds on all systems where you found a local administrator? If so, you'll for sure enjoy ntlmrelayx2proxychains! :)\n Link: https://github.com/He-No/ntlmrelayx2proxychains\n    submitted by    /u/BugbearB  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello, im taking a course by Sektor7. i have the problem that, no matter in which way i try, i cant get a metasploit payload executed correctly by any loader (cpp) in the course. The program run, but there was no meterpreter session opened no more What I tried:\n  \nSimple xor encryption and decryption\n Simple AES encryption and decryption\n Even base64 encoding doesnt work for me\n  \nI also tried to research the root of the problem with no success. The source I used already was fixed for all problems any debugger gave me:\n The python script for aes encryption: https://pastebin.com/Qyxa3Zrr\n The cpp loader that decrypts and runs the payload in memory: https://pastebin.com/MfVynd45\n the compiler (a custom batch): https://pastebin.com/rn6zXfqi\n I already tried to generate a PE with msfvenom and run it through the python, did not work. I tried to generate the raw payload with msfvenom, then encrypt it manually and put in aes key and payload into the cpp, didnt work. I tried to generate with -f raw -o 1.bin, then run the .bin through the python, didnt work.\n Note: Only the provided shellcodes by Sektor7 seem to work flawlessly. These have no other function besides executing the calc.exe from the System32 folder or showing basic messages. Maybe the sheer size of metasploit generated payloads or its custom functions make them going broken during the cryption and compilation process? If yes, why and how to design the loaders they dont break the payload?\n    submitted by    /u/janameyers2002  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello,\n I'm a 21 years old finishing his computer science university degree. I've always been fascinated by security and after having a look around, the two areas that intrigue me are reverse engineering/malware analysis and exploitation in general.\n The entry barriers in both these fields are very hard and the learning curve is very steep. I've seen the pwn2own videos for exploitation and oalabs for malware analysis and, I have to admit it, I understood like less than 5% of what they said, so it'll be a lot of work.\n ​\n I've done some research and I came up with a roadmap for reverse engineering/malware analysis:\n -C/C++ and Assembly (for asm I think it's best to start with a simple architecture, like MIPS, then move into x32/x64)\n -start writing small programs and reverse them using both a debugger/disassembler, learning about how they translate into assembly\n -learn about common malware techniques: unpacking, persistence techniques, process injection, obfuscation, building a sandbox, building a honeypot for capturing samples and so on.\n ​\n The problems start with exploitation, here I am completely lost. I was able to find some basic explanations and tutorials about buffer/heap overflows, integer overflow, double free, use after free, null pointer dereference. It seems however that going from theory to practice is very very hard. Another subject that goes hand in hand with exploitation is fuzzing, which of course I don't understand.\n ​\n Last thing, I've seen a blog post where someone was able to get code execution on a program using DLL Sideloading, is this related to exploitation?\n ​\n What resources, courses, books, tips, tricks can I follow in order to get better and better in these two fields?\n Last but not least, English is not my mother tongue, sorry for any mistakes. Thanks for taking your time to read and for an eventual reply, have a good day ahead!\n    submitted by    /u/worldpwner  \n [link]   [comments]",

But with that said I'd really enjoy doing application security as a career.\n Does anyone have any advice in regards to entering the application security world from a support role? Or would it be better for me to pursue network security and then try to switch to application security later? \n Also should I pursue any certs that might help? I've thought about OSWE in the future.\n Any advice would be great, and again if this post doesn't belong here I can delete. Thanks.\n    submitted by    /u/n3v327311  \n [link]   [comments]",

I held sessions where we practiced (beginner) buffer overflows. \n While in school I had done research on hardware reverse engineering, focused on medical devices. \n That got me to present with my peers at our local bsides. I then was able to present at IEEE southeastcon, which got me a job as a security engineer before graduating. \n -----‐\n 1) Is it possible to get into exploit dev without a degree or is it absolutely necessary?\n 2) should I go the pentester route and then exploit dev?\n 3) do you see security engineers break into this field or does it tend to be developers? I don't do any software engineering, but I do a lot of tooling in powershell, python, and recently, go. I know C but hardly. \n 4) should I just shaddup and start learning?

Effectively like any other GUI based viewer such as FTK imager (but via command line instead.)\n I don't know of any software/scripts that allow me to do this? any advice?\n An alternative is, I could auto mount an E01 file with some software, and then search the mounted file system for artefacts in set locations such as prefetch files. then export them to my workstation.

I still use it sometimes here back home in Sweden because it kind of makes me feel like haxor. \n Tails is supposedly completely amnesic and leaves 0 trace on the system after you've used it and shut it down. \n In Sweden, you need \"physical\" evidence to convict someone of a cyber crime. Just having logs of a specific IP doing something is (as far as I know) not enough, you also need logs or files etc on the suspects computer proving that the person did what they did. For example, if they have tracked that a specific IP address is buying illegal drugs, they also need to find evidence on the suspects computer of illegal activity. \n If Tails really is completely amnesic, would that not mean that its impossible to convict tails users of cyber crimes in countries with the same laws as Sweden unless you actually swat them and catch them in the act before they can shut it down?\n    submitted by    /u/CompoteDizzy  \n [link]   [comments]",

I do have IT industry certs (none of the majors ones) but no degree. \n Whilst in this role, I have made a couple extremely minor operational changes (by minor, I mean barely making it to the CV/resume) which has reminded me of my drive for a business analyst type role. \n My salary is decent for this type of role and is more than what an entry level business analyst role would be. I would be willing to take a small pay cut but from what I’ve seen it would be around a 10k pay cut which I just cannot absorb. \n Besides the problem mentioned above, if at all possible, how would I transition from this role to a business role e.g. business analyst/design?\n Has anyone done the same? \n I considered writing in r/careerguidance but I cannot imagine many people in that subreddit knowing much about LE forensics.\n    submitted by    /u/gofigured21  \n [link]   [comments]",

The assignment gave us two forensically imaged drives, one was the source of the alleged attack (a student) and the 'victim' was another (the teacher). I have my suspicions (based on the class) that the scan was not malicious but the product of a malware attack through open ports, but that's what I want to find out! I just started using encase8 (moved from encase6), so my proficiency is abysmal currently with the new UI.\n For those who have experience out there, what should I be looking at first? programs to use that may be better than encase (and free)?\n My gut says to try and find programs of execution and build a timeline.

          "description": "Hi there, hoping some of you are Magnet Axiom users and may be able to help me with this conundrum I have *some nonessential information has been altered for protection*:\n I have received a Portable Case from someone who has full license to the platform. I understand how the Portable Case is created (via watching the Magnet tutorial videos). The Portable Case is supposed to contain the contents of John Doe's cell phone. \n Separately, I have Snapchat Returns for John Doe's Snapchat account, and as far as is known John Doe only owned the one aforementioned cell phone. \n In looking at the Artifacts in the Portable Case, there seem to be things missing.\n For example: The Portable Case is supposed to cover a time period of 01/01/2XXX through 05/15/2XXX. When comparing the Snapchat Returns > Snapchat Memories I am able to see a specific video file - I'll call it \"Selfie A\" - from 02/03/2XXX 08-48-56 UTC.\n But when looking at the Portable Case > CHAT > Snapchat Memories artifacts there is no corresponding artifact. There are other video artifacts from that same date and around that time, but not \"Selfie A.\"\n There are many files I have identified with this same issue. \n So now the question: I will admit I have not had formal training on Axiom (nor am I a digital forensics professional by trade) so I am willing to withhold suspicion for now, but, is it possible that artifacts could appear from Snapchat Returns that were missed in Axiom? Maybe \"Selfie A\" was deleted from the phone so it doesn't appear in Axiom but it does appear in the Returns data from Snapchat? (I hate even typing that question because I know even \"deleted\" things can be forensically recovered but go with me here).\n Or, is it more likely that the \"Selfie A\" artifact is visible in the Snapchat Returns but not in the Portable Case because the creator of said Portable Case chose not to include the artifact?\n    submitted by    /u/mclaughlinkessell  \n [link]   [comments]",

So it would rather be impossible for the suspect to get on his whatsapp without his sim-card(this is in our possesion as well).\n We also use the UFED cellebrite, but whatsapp conversations don't always come through.\n So what are our options to be able to get back into whatsapp without loss of data?\n ​\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/Tniso  \n [link]   [comments]",

Right now I'm exploring different data acquisition tools.\n I tried to image a usb device using FTK Imager (on a Windows system) and dd from the SIFT workstation (linux).\n I noticed that: 1. These two imaging tools provide image data of different sizes. 2. FTK automatically verifies the hash of the device and the image - both hashes were the same. 3. For the dd image, I verified it by myself and they were the same. \n I have few questions: 1. Why is the hash of the same device different on FTK (running on windows) and when checking on the SIFT Workstation (linux) ? 2. If different tools provide different images, do analysts use a combination of multiple tools? 3.

I.e. Create a special LICENSE on open source projects, organize a non for-profit with rotating analysts, pro-bono cyber, etc.\n    submitted by    /u/Jklm264  \n [link]   [comments]",

(if not touching anything oc) 2) Working as root, is chmod a-w /dev/sde (the drive \"location\") really useful, like will it really prevent any write even from root ? 3) Created an image with dcfldd, asked for sha1 checksum, and before imaging used sha1sum on /dev/sde. They match. Do anyone work another way ? 4) Tried to import the image on autopsy with different settings but no file or anything else found. Then successfully linked to /dev/loop1 using losetup, but could not mount the \"partition\" (no filesystem nor partition is detected with parted -l, but gparted tells sde is an ataraid partition). Had some error like \"unknown filesystem type 'ddf_raid_member'\", so after a bit of digging tried some stuff with mdamd, but did not work.

I do not come from a background in IT, and have been figuring this all out on my own in the past few years. I have acquired a set (x3) of USB drives to collect images and videos from clients phones in an easier way. I have added the exact nomenclature of what I have below. I need this to be done in a forensically sound manner, and I am currently going through the steps to validate my theory these collect data in a forensically sound manner. To be forensically sound any media should be \"zeroed\" or wiped prior to use. Herein lies my question. With these flash drives they obviously have some sort of proprietary software which makes them work. If I were to format these I would lose this proprietary software. What would be a way I could format these drives and then return them to \"manufacturer settings\"?\n ​\n I have looked into USB duplicators, not sure if this could be a forensically sound option.

We've talked with 2 other cellebrite users who both said they had to buy a $4-5k desktop build to work efficiently with cellebrite.\n I've built a pc before and have a basic knowledge about them, however I don't get these $4k+ build costs when all that's really necessary is an average build with an intell processor and a decent amount of ram. Besides that I have put in a good chunk of the budget to cover memory and additional hard drives to handle data/evidence. \n Are the other cellebrite users just getting railroaded by vendors selling them over priced pre-built models or is there something more to the build/requirements.\n Any advice would be greatly appreciated.\n    submitted by    /u/crimsontidepride  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Just started working with this program. I understand how to open and browse extractions, but I can't figure out if there's a better way to pick up where I left off after closing the program, I end up having to open/import all the extractions one by one again.\n For most programs that I'm familiar with, a \"case\" contains one or more extractions that I imported and \"opening a case\" tends to be a convenient way to bring up all the extractions in one \"click\". However, based on how little experience I have with PA, \"opening a case\" seems to just be a prompt to import extractions all over again. I thought about using \"project sessions\", but it seems to be something that you open after all the extractions are open that remembers what analysis you've done, not necessarily what devices you were working on.\n Can anyone speak to this? Am I oblivious to a basic function that lets me easily open all the extractions I had open? Maybe I'm supposed to create a portable case (UFDX?) or something?\n    submitted by    /u/PieWithIceCreamCrust  \n [link]   [comments]",

I know you can work in law enforcement and do forensics analysis to find digital evidence of a suspect (wich is most cases I belive), but can you work on the investigation field (like tracing criminals online)? If not, how do I work on this investigation field related to crimes online?

One of our external vendors was running a VAPT test on the vlan containing the cameras at the same time they went down. The CCTV logs show us that XSS and SQL injection attacks were being run on the cameras. Checking the application log tells us the time when the cameras stopped recording and the time they got back online. However I am unable to figure out what was the exact attack that brought down the cameras.

It seems to be just in simple json formatting.\n When I enter the site through builtwith.com I can see some of it is hosted on AWS EC2 in addition to vercel.\n In the a .js file - the API is pulled in like:\n _getPairs = async () => { try { const response = await fetch(`${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API}/api/v1/pairs`, { method: 'get', headers: { 'Authorization': `Basic ${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_TOKEN}`, } }) const pairsCall = await response.json() return pairsCall.data } catch(ex) { console.log(ex) return [] } } \n and\n updatePairsCall = async ( account) => { try { const response = await fetch(`${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API}/api/v1/updatePairs`, { method: 'get', headers: { 'Authorization': `Basic ${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_TOKEN}`, } }) const pairsCall = await response.json() this.setStore({ pairs: pairsCall.data }) await this._getPairInfo( account, pairsCall.data) } catch(ex) { console.log(ex) } } \n ​\n Is there an easy way to re-create this API?

If you're still interested in future dumps you can track them on the other one.\n Other resources will be proposed on it soon, like a wiki, tips, the datasets, original calibres, and some news about related tools like calisuck, calishot ... which are now turning into a single new project and will be released soon.\n Your contributions are also welcome on the sub.\n    submitted by    /u/krazybug  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi Reddit,\n I've been trying to download this website (Cisco RV325 Emulator - Emulator) for full offline usage, and have used a variety of different tools with little success so far. I know it can be done because people have linked zip file downloads for other emulators in the cisco forums.\n I've tried wget, httrack, archivebox and several online website downloaders, however the problem I'm facing is as follows:\n If I download https://www.cisco.com/assets/sol/sb/RV325_Emulators/RV325_Emulator-SB_v1-2-1-14/default.htm I can load up the page locally but clicking on any of the menu items does nothing. It is just a static page which looks correct but isn't functional. I've tested winhttrack and wget settings of (-m -k) (-r -np -c) and another which uses (-l0) but I can't remember what the rest of the args were.\n From inspecting some of the urls using the online working version, I can see that each menu item has its own unique .htm page, which can be opened separately (online) if you just wanted to view that page and not be able to traverse to other pages (there is no menu bar).\n For example:\n Main Page - https://www.cisco.com/assets/sol/sb/RV325_Emulators/RV325_Emulator-SB_v1-2-1-14/default.htm\n Using the sidebar to go from Homepage > Port Management > Port setup, the online url is unchanged but clearly a separate static page for it exists because you can go to https://www.cisco.com/assets/sol/sb/RV325_Emulators/RV325_Emulator-SB_v1-2-1-14/lan_setting.htm and access the same thing (only that page's settings, not anything else)\n This means that if I downloaded this lan_setting.htm page and pointed to it in the local html, I should be able to access it right?\n The problem is that I don't know how to find all of these individual settings .htm page urls, and downloading them all manually and setting up local links in the main html file would take forever.\n ​\n I hope I've explained this well enough, please accept my apologies in advance if I haven't !\n    submitted by    /u/prymenumba  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Before you tell me to just shill for a VPS, run a crawler and some scripts; I would like to offer some insight. I like collecting old web GIFs and pixel art. These are typically from websites which are hardly active, or in some cases no longer online. Places other people would, usually, share on r/opendirectories. Ergo, whenever I pick these out it's already going to be a manual process.\n I suppose I can just right click + save as, a few hundred times, but I have found Pinterest's \"Save Button\" to also be convenient. It's an extension that scans the entire page quickly, and you can choose what to save through a convenient menu, and it even builds a gallery for me. I want to reshare these, so I don't consider it a violation of my privacy that they are being exposed under my account name. False Account Suspensions aren't unheard of, but it's been working for me so far. Except whenever I need to save any image smaller than 100x100 pixels.\n Pinterest has a restriction requiring all images to be above 100x100 in resolution, so in this case you have to Save As, pad out the background and then upload. Which is again, a level of tedium I would like to avoid.\n So, would any of you lovely folks happen to know any decent alternatives?\n    submitted by    /u/themadprogramer  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Please delete if not allowed\n Hi guys, awhile ago I made a quick and easy browser tool to convert links into a VLC Playlist, you might be wondering why I opted out of M3U playlists, honestly for future expansion, m3u playlists tend to be pretty simple on the SPEC, can't define much, while XPSF allows for things like duration setting. It is a goal to rewrite this eventually and figure out a way of showing the duration, probably using an API of some kind. (my tool: https://csmit195.github.io/Links-to-XSPF-Web-App/)\n I have two files, one is 14.1k movies, and the other is 4.1k movies. My PC is fairly fast and loading the 14.1k movies took about 3mins, while the 4.1k only takes 10secs. Please test carefully with the 14.1k, some PC's might fail to load it, vlc could crash b4 finish loading.\n Downloads:\n note: the top 1.1k movies of both files are more popular than the ones below it\n 14.1K Movies (4.1K Movies from below included)\n https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gSjguuPTTyP_2oVktKD_YqbaAZStpEu4/view?usp=sharing\n 4.1K Movies\n https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dSb3d_CDbsvR7UO8nnnDBdYmJmsuBPv2/view?usp=sharing\n If you want more or have a really good source of direct movie links, feel free to lmk and I'll create more playlists. For now, enjoy and would love feedback (please no code reviews, I made it quickly so I can achieve this goal, wasn't really built for production, I'd love to optimise it in the future tho.\n Cheers,\n Chris\n    submitted by    /u/csmit195  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "As crazy as it sounds, we’re releasing a casual free-to-play mobile auto-battler for Android and iOS. We’re not changing line of business - just having fun with computers!\nWe believe that the greatest learning lessons come from outside your comfort zone, so whether it is a security audit or a new side hustle we’re always challenging ourself to improve the craft.\nDuring the fall of 2019, we embarked on a pretty ambitious goal despite the virtually zero experience in game design. We partnered with a small game studio that was just getting started and decided to combine forces to design and develop a casual mobile game set in the *cyber* space. After many prototypes and changes of direction, we spent a good portion of 2020 spare time to work on the core mechanics and graphics. Unfortunately, the limited time and budget further delayed beta testing and the final release. Making a game is no joke, especially when it is a combined side project for two thriving businesses.\nDespite all, we’re happy to announce the release of H1.Jack for Android and iOS as a free-to-play with no advertisement. We hope you’ll enjoy the game in between your commutes and lunch breaks!\nAndroid: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.CobbleGames.Hijack\niOS (iPhone and iPad)  https://apps.apple.com/app/hijack-game/id1517609205\nNo malware included.\nH1.Jack is a casual mobile auto-battler inspired by cyber security events. Start from the very bottom and spend your money and fame in gaining new techniques and exploits. Heartbleed or Shellshock won’t be enough!\nWhile playing, you might end up talking to John or Luca.\nOur monsters are procedurally generated, meaning there will be tons of unique systems, apps, malware and bots to hack. Battle levels are also dynamically generated. If you want a sneak peek, check out the trailer:",

For example, JavaScript is throttled in background tabs, and these tabs don’t render web content. This reduces CPU, GPU and memory usage, which leaves more memory, CPU and GPU for foreground tabs that the user actually sees. However, the logic was limited to tabs that weren't focused in their window, or windows that were minimiz…",

          "description": "Users want frequently used applications such as Email, Chat, and other productivity apps to automatically start when they log in to their devices. Auto-starting these apps at login streamlines the user experience as users don't have to manually start apps after logging into their devices. \nWindows, Mac, and Linux devices allow users to configure native apps to be launched automatically on startup. In Chrome 91, we introduced the Run on OS Login feature. With the launch of this feature, users can now configure desktop web apps to launch automatically when they log-in to the device on Windows, Mac, and Linux devices. Installed apps will not be permitted to automatically enable themselves to run when the user logs in. A manual user gesture will always be required. \nTo configure apps to run on OS login, open Chrome browser. Navigate to chrome://apps or click the ‘Apps' icon in your bookmark bar (example below). \n\nTo configure an app to start at login, first right click on it. From the context menu, select ‘Start app when you sign in' and you are all set. Next time when you log in to your device, the app will automatically launch on its own. To disable this feature for an app, navigate to chrome://apps. Right click on the app to bring up the context menu and deselect the option, ‘Start app when you sign in'.\n\nApps launched through Run on OS Login are launched only after the device is running. ‘Run on OS Login' is a browser only feature and doesn't expose any launch source information to app developers.\nWe're continuously improving the web platform to provide safe, low friction ways for users to get their day-to-day tasks done. Support for running installed web apps on OS login is a small but significant step to simplifying the startup routine for users that want apps like chat, email, or calendar clients to start as soon as they turn on their computer. As always, we're looking forward to your feedback. Your input will help us prioritize next steps!\n \n\nPosted by Pratyush Sinha",

          "description": "The Payment Request API is a soon-to-be-recommended web standard that aims to make building low-friction and secure payment flows easier for developers. The browser facilitates the flow between a merchant website and \"payment handlers\". A payment handler can be built-in to the browser, a native app installed on user’s mobile device, or a Progressive Web App. Today, developers can use the Payment Request API to access several payment methods, including “basic-card” and Google Pay in Chrome on most platforms, Apple Pay in Safari, Digital Goods API on Google Play, and Secure Payment Confirmation in Chrome.\n\nEarlier last year, we announced that we will deprecate the \"basic-card\" payment handler on iOS Chrome, followed by other platforms in the future. The \"basic-card\" is a payment method that is typically built into the browser to help users easily enter credit card numbers without remembering and typing them. This was designed to make a good transition from a form based credit card payment to an app based tokenized card payment. In order to better pursue the goal of app based payment (and a few other reasons), the Web Payments WG decided to remove it from the specification.\n\nStarting from version 96, Chrome will show a warning message in DevTools Console (together with creating a report to Reporting API) when the \"basic-card\" payment method is used. In version 100, the \"basic-card\" payment method will be no longer available and canMakePayment() will return false unless other capable payment methods are specified. This applies to all platforms including Android, macOS, Windows, Linux, and Chrome OS.\n\nIf you are using the Payment Request API with the \"basic-card\" payment handler, we suggest removing it as soon as possible and using an alternative payment method such as Google Pay or Samsung Pay.\n\n\nPosted by Eiji Kitamura, Developer Advocate on the Chrome team",

Based on feedback from our Enterprise and Education customers and partners, we have made the decision to extend Chrome app support for those users on Chrome OS until at least January 2025. \n\n\nWe continue to invest and have made significant progress in rich new capabilities on the Web platform with Progressive Web Apps (PWA), and we recommend that Chrome app developers migrate to PWAs as soon as possible. PWAs are built and enhanced with modern APIs to deliver enhanced capabilities, reliability, and installability while reaching anyone, anywhere, on any device with a single codebase. There is a growing ecosystem of powerful desktop web apps & PWAs, from advanced graphics products like Adobe Spark to engaging media apps like YouTube TV to productivity and collaboration apps like Zoom.\n\n\nFor additional support with Chrome app migration, please visit our Web apps on Chrome OS page. This page will be kept up to date as we progress together through this process.\n\n\nWe thank our community of developers who have provided feedback to help us shape this modified and simplified approach.

          "description": "When a browser connects to websites over HTTPS (vs. HTTP), eavesdroppers and attackers on the network can't intercept or alter the data that's shared over that connection (including personal info, or even the page itself). This level of privacy and security is vital for the web ecosystem, so Chrome continues to invest in making HTTPS more widely supported.\n\n\nThankfully, HTTPS adoption has come a long way in recent years, and most operating systems now see 90%+ of page loads over HTTPS in Chrome. Still, there's more we can do to help make HTTPS the preferred protocol on the web, and better protect users on the remaining slice of the web that doesn’t yet support HTTPS, so today we're sharing some future work in this area.\n\n\n\n\n\nOpting in to an HTTPS-First World\n\n\nBeginning in M94, Chrome will…",

We’re excited to also share our plans today for adjusting the Chrome OS release schedule. \nTo deliver new features more rapidly to consumers while also continuing to prioritize the key pillars of Chrome OS – security, stability, speed and simplicity – Chrome OS will move to a 4-week stable channel starting with M96 in Q4. For enterprise and education users, Chrome OS will also introduce a new channel with a 6-month update cadence by M96. More details to be announced soon.\nTo bridge the gap between M94 when Chrome moves to a four week release and M96, Chrome OS will skip M95 (see the updated Chrome schedule page for milestone-specific details). \nAs we head into our next decade, these changes enable us to evolve Chrome OS to keep helping people get things done and to provide more helpful and secure experiences.\n\nMarina Kazatcker, Chrome OS Release TPM Lead",

Chrome 92 is beta as of June 3, 2021\n File Handling API\nNow that web apps are capable of reading and writing files, the next logical step is to let developers declare web apps as file handlers for files they create and process. The File Handling API allows you to do exactly this. For example, after a text editor PWA has registered itself as a file handler, you can right-click a .txt file in your operating system's file manager and instruct this PWA to (always or just once) open .txt files. This means PWAs are just a (double) click away from…",

The V8 JavaScript compiler is a critical part of delivering maximum speed for the JavaScript that’s shipped on practically every web page. In our next post in The Fast and the Curious series, we are excited to share how improvements to the V8 engine are delivering up to 23% faster performance.\n\n\nAn important component of delivering a fast browser is fast JavaScript execution. In Chrome, that job is done by the V8 engine which executes over 78 years worth of JavaScript code on a daily basis. In M91 Chrome is now up to 23% faster with the launch of a new Sparkplug compiler and short builtin calls, saving over 17 years of our users' CPU time each da…",

          "description": "Today, people have many ways to keep up with their favorite websites, including subscribing to mailing lists, notifications and RSS. It’s a lot for any one person to manage, so we’re exploring how to simplify the experience of getting the latest and greatest from your favorite sites directly in Chrome, building on the open RSS web standard. Our vision is to help people build a direct connection with their favorite publishers and creators on the web.\nIn the coming weeks, some Android users in the US on Chrome Canary may see an experimental Follow feature designed to help people get the latest content from sites they follow. Our goal for this feature is to allow people to follow the websites they care about, from the large publishers to the small neighborhood blogs, by tapping a Follow button in Chrome. When websites publish content, users can see updates from sites they have followed in a new Following section on the New Tab page:\n\n\n\n\nKeeping a site’s RSS up-to-date will ensure Chrome can provide the latest content to users with this experiment. We will provide more guidance to web publishers as we learn and evaluate whether this feature will graduate from an experiment to a broader rollout in Chrome. \nWe welcome feedback from publishers, bloggers, creators, and citizens of the open web (like you!) on this experiment as we aim to build deeper engagement between users and web publishers in Chrome. You can also stay up-to-date and ask us questions via @WebCreators on Twitter or via email to webcreators@google.com. As part of this year’s Google I/O, we’ll be hosting a Meet Up for web publishers, creators and developers who would like to learn more, ask questions and share feedback. You can sign up for I/O (free this year) and register for the Following on the Open Web session, being held on May 19 (today) at 11 AM PT.\n\nPosted by Janice Wong, Product Manager, Google Chrome",

This has enabled all sorts of multi-staged payloads, modular program functionality, and fileless post-exploitation operations.  \nA few months back some tooling I was working on caused me to take a closer look into the mechanisms behind loading assemblies into the .net Common Language Runtime (CLR).  I fou…",

          "description": "I am getting obsessed with the nonlinear way of discovering things.\nFor example, let's say you want to use machine learning to classify many strings, but you don't know anything about this topic. The linear approach would be to start learning about ML from the basics, and once you have enough knowledge, you will be able to solve your specific problem. By the time you reach this point, you find out that your problem domain is not a good fit for what you've learned (your knowledge is not practical for the problem domain), and thus the experience is disappointing.\nThe nonlinear way would go like this. You want to classify many strings using machine learning, but you don't know anything about this topic. You download brain.js and start doing some random problems not related to your problem domain which ultimately leads to a discovery or an insight in a different area. Now you innovate.\nThe illusion everyone in tech has is that it is possible to develop innovative solutions by following a linear path: A, B, C, D. But, innovation is never linear. If innovation was linear, it would have been repeatable as it will be possible to work forward and backwards with relative ease. Instead, we know that innovation is random, and it comes from unexpected places.",
